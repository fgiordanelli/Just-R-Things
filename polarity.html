<h1>1: <em><span style="color: red">-.456</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "pos">loved these headphones and they technically lasted a year and a half of full-time use...</mark> <mark class = "neg">but within six months of getting them they basically started to fall apart.</mark> <mark class = "neg">if you look at the 1 star reviews you see the cord just is junk.</mark> <mark class = "neg">problem one.</mark> <mark class = "neg">one of the cord buttons also just fell off , so that was also an unpleasant early-ish fault.</mark> <mark class = "neg">problem two.</mark> <mark class = "neg">about a year in one of the ears inside metal piece (the thing with a lot of tiny holes in it) just fell into the plastic part ; anytime the music was loud or bassy the metal bit would vibrate creating quite a bit of weird sounds.</mark> <mark class = "neg">problem three.</mark> <mark class = "neg">and then about 2 weeks ago the plastic on the the head phone side with the above issue cracked and all working stopped.</mark> <mark class = "neg">problem four.</mark> <mark class = "pos">admittedly , i'm probably a bit to laissez-faire with my objects , so it's possible that problems 3 and 4 are my fault , but the cord seems to be a consistent issue that's not limited to my experiences.</mark></p>
<h1>2: <em><span style="color: red">-.461</span></em></h1><p class="indented"><mark class = "neg">i bought  these 1 month back , now it is not working , there is problem in mic and control , it just keep on playing and pausing my songs.</mark> <mark class = "neg">it increase my volume automatically it is just annoying ....</mark></p>
<h1>3: <em><span style="color: red">-.266</span></em></h1><p class="indented">i have owned two pairs of mie2i. <mark class = "pos">the headsets produced excellent sound , fit comfortably and if you use the headset for fitness it allows you to hear ambient noises while running or cycling.</mark> <mark class = "neg"> as a cyclist , they would be my favorite ; but , the microphone and control buttons are the headset's achilles heel.</mark> <mark class = "neg"> on both of my headsets the buttons failed.</mark> the iphone would skip through songs ; and activate voice control or other functions uncommanded. the microphone button would stick open and on one headset the microphone quit working entirely. <mark class = "neg"> very disappointing!</mark>  if you purchase this product , treat it gingerly. come on bose , give us the outdoor version.</p>
