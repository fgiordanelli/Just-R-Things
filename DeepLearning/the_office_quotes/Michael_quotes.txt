All right. Well, let me show you how it's done.
So you've come to the master for guidance? Is this what you're saying, grasshopper?
It's called the wastepaper basket! Look at that! Look at that face.
Oh! Pam, this is from Corporate. How many times have I told you? There's a special filing cabinet for things from corporate.
If you think she's cute now, you should have seen her a couple of years ago.
Back to work.
OK. All right. See you later.
OK. No problem.
All the alarm bells are kind of going... ringie-dingie-ding!
No, no, no, no, this is good. This is good. This is fine. Excellent.
Yeah, yeah. Lovely. Thank you.
Yeah, that was a joke. That was a joke that was actually my brother's, and... It was supposed to be with bills and it doesn't work great with faxes.
Why isn't it in my hand? A company runs on efficiency of communication, right? So what's the problem, Pam? Why didn't I get it?
Really? I didn't...  Did we get a fax this morning?
I didn't get any agenda.
Um... Me no get an agenda.
No, absolutely. Under this regime, it will not leave this office.  Like that.
Oh, my God! Oh! That's... horrifying. Horrible. Horrible person.
Uh, I don't know what you mean.Todd P
Oh, that's not appropriate.Todd P
Watch this. This is Moe. Nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck-nyuck. Mee!
Howard, like Moe Howard. Three Stooges.
Guilty! Guilty as charged!
If you're unhappy with your compensation, maybe you should take it up with HR. OK. Not today, OK? Pam, just be professional.
Come on. Six-Million Dollar Man! Steve Austin! Actually, that would be a good salary for me, don't you think? Six million dollars? Memo to Jan. I deserve a raise.
Relax. Everything's under control. Uh, yeah. Yeah. That's important. Right. Oh this is so important, I should run to answer it.
Corporate has deemed it appropriate to enforce an ultimatum upon me. And Jan is thinking about downsizing either the Stamford branch or this branch.
I don't need your permission. D
You don't know what it is.
I'm about to tell everybody. I'm just about to tell everybody.
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
No, Stanley. No, you did not see me in there with her. I said if Corporate wants to come in here and interfere, then they're gonna have to go through me. Right? You can go mess with Josh's people, but I'm the head of this family, and you ain't gonna be messing with my chillin.
Well, Pam maybe you should stick to the ongoing confidentiality agreement of meetings.
I know. Hold on a second. I think Pam wanted to say something. Pam, you had a look that you wanted to ask a question just then.
Well, yeah, it is a promise. And frankly, I'm a little insulted that you have to keep asking about it.
It won't be out of my hands Stanley, OK. I promise you that.
Not gonna happen.
That's his profit.
Assistant to the Regional Manager. So, uh, Dwight tell him about the kung fu and the car and everything.
Introduce yourself. Be polite. D
OK. Hold on, hold on. The judge is in session. What is the problem here?
Pudding. Pudding... I'm trying to think of another dessert to do.
Hey! Yes! New guy! He scores.
Nice. That's the way it is around here. It just kind of goes round and round.
And yeah, Jim this is the time to stop putting Dwight's personal effects into Jell-O.
Discipline. Kinky!  All right, here's the deal you guys. The thing about a practical joke is you have to know when to start and as well as when to stop.
No, no, no. Do not take it out. You have to eat it out of there, because there are starving people in the world  which I hate, and it is a waste of that kind of food.
I don't know about that.
Surprise! It's a joke. We were joking around. See? OK. He was in on it. He was my accomplice. And it was kind of a morale booster thing. And we were showing the new guy around, giving him the feel of the place. So you... God, we totally got you.
But the best thing about it is that we're not going to have to give you any severance pay. Because that is gross misconduct and... Just clean out your desk. I'm sorry.
Yeah. I am.
50 cents, yeah. If you steal a thousand Post-It Notes at 50 cents apiece, and you know,  you've made a profit... margin. You're gonna run us out of business, Pam.
Why? Well, theft and stealing.
Oh, thank you. Pam, can you come in here for a sec. Just have a seat. I was gonna call you in anyway. You know Ryan. As you know, there is going to be downsizing. And you have made my life so much easier in that I am going to have to let you go first.
Just follow my lead. Don't pimp me, all right? Come in. So, uh, Corporate just said that I don't want to...
You are gonna be my accomplice. Just go along with it, OK?
Gotcha. Good. I'd go with the rows. That's a good idea.
It's diversity day, Jim. I wish every day was diversity day.
Oh hey, well, diversity, everybody, let's do it. Oscar works in... here. Jim, could you wrap it up, please?
Right. See? I don't even know, first-name basis!Mr. B
Oh yeah, I bet it was fun.  Oh, hey! This is Oscar---
Did you have a good weekend going there?
Ah. Oh, right! OK. First test. I will not call you that.Mr. B
OK. Why don't we just defer to Mr...Mr. B
You know what? Here's what we're going to do. Why don't we go around and everybody... everybody say a race that you are attracted to sexually. I will go last. Go.
Celebrate good times. Come on! Let's celebrate diversity. Right?Mr. B
Let's celebrate.Mr. B
With tolerance.Mr. B
Exactly, were not...Mr. B
You know what? This is a color-free-zone here. Stanley, I don't look at you as another race.Mr. B
Come on people, let's get 'em in. Get in the cards! Get in the cards!Mr. B
OK, I will play guy listening.Mr. B
I will play the Chris Rock guy. I would like to see someone else pull this off.Mr. B
What you want a cookie?
They always want credit for something they supPOSED to do!Mr. B
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. He's ruin... He's butchering it. Could you just let me...  I take care of my kid!Mr. B
Well, OK, it says here that I learned something and I knew all this stuff already, so... I know, I could sign something that says that I taught something, or that I helped you teach something, so... Pam! Where is she? Pam, could we change something on this?Mr. B
I don't think I can sign this.Mr. B
I won't.Mr. B
Well, here I am thinking that you actually cared about diversity training. And you don't.Mr. B
OK, well I know. You told me that several times.Mr. B
Here's the thing. This office, I think this is very advanced in terms of... racial awareness and it's probably more advanced than you're used to. That's probably throwing you off a little bit.Mr. B
"I pledge to always keep an open mind and an open heart." I do believe... in that part of the pledge I that just read. But a pledge? Come on. I mean who are we, the Girl Scouts? No. Look... the guy, "Mr. Brown," he got us halfway there. He got us talking. Well, no. I got us talking. He got us nothing. He insulted us and he abandoned us. You call that diversity training? I don't. Were there any connections between any of us? Did anyone look each other in the eye? Was there any emotion going on? No. Where was the heart? I didn't see any heart. Where was my Oprah moment? OK, get as much done as you can before lunch because, afterward, I'm going to have you all in tears.
No, this is not a joke. OK? That was offensive and lame. So double offensive. This is an environment of welcoming and you should just get the hell out of here. OK, let's go. Let's do it. Come on. Let's have some fun, everybody. Here we go. Take a seat. Cop a squat. And um... thanks for coming in. Um... Diversity... is the cornerstone of progress as I've always said. But don't take my word for it. Let's take a look at the tape.
...empathy, respect...  Jim! Jim!
No. Now, remember that honesty...
Like... I don't... I don't know.
Well, it has certain connotations.
Um, let me ask you, is there a term besides Mexican that you prefer? Something less offensive?
Wow. That is... That is a great story. That's the American Dream right there, right?
Well, you know what, it's kind of hard for me to talk about it. Their suffering. So who else? Let's get this popping. Come on. Who's going? Who's going? Let's go here. Oscar, right here. You're on.
Yeah, well, if you leave we'll only have two left. Yes. Enjoy. Absolutely. Namaste. Ok, well since I am leading this, let's get down to business and why don't I just kind of introduce myself, OK? Um. I am Michael and I am part English, Irish, German and Scottish. Sort of a virtual United Nations. But what some of you might not know is that I am also part Native American Indian.
Uh, yes. That probably had something to do with the camera work. Anybody else? Um...
Yes. I only had an hour to put it together but I'm going to add on to it later on.
Pam, come on. "I like your food." Come on stir the pot. Stir the melting pot, Pam! Let's do it. Let's get ugly. Let's get real.
No, that was inadvertent. We didn't actually plan that.
Good. Bom bom bom-bom bom. Come on Olympics of Suffering right here. Slavery versus the Holocaust. Come on.
OK. All right. No. It's good. You just need to push it. You need to go a little bit further. All right. OK.
All right! All right! Yes! That was great, she gets it! Now she knows what it's like to be a minority.
Oh! Welcome to my convenience store. Would you like some googi googi? I have some very delicious googi, googi, only 99 cents plus tax. Try my googi, googi.
That doesn't really make sense. Because you don't call them collared people, that's offensive. Hmmm... OK, well, it's after five. So... Thank you very much. Buena vista Oscar. Thank you. Good job. Oh, my man. Thank you Brazil. Nice.
Okay, Kevin. You can take that off that thing, OK? That would really, really have shown him up, wouldn't it? If I'd brought in some burritos or some colored greens. Or some pad Thai. I love pad Thai.
Okay, all right. Let's keep on track. Keep on point. Let's do it.
Oh, okay. Here we go, breakthrough radar. What happened? What happened here?
It's good. This is good. We got it happening now. All right? Let's keep it rolling. Let's round it up.
That's not what you said earlier.
Lay them on me. What?
Let's go. Messages. Stat. Lots to do, lots to do. Information superhighway.
When have you ever done that?
Well, it's a suicide mission, you know.
Well, that is kind of a tough assignment. Um... It won't be popular decision around the old orifice.
You gotta crack these things open.
Well, I'd recommend it. It's very good.
I think it was you who didn't look closely enough at the Gold Plan.
I am going to go with the best, Jan. I am going to go with the one with the acupuncture, therapeutic massage, you know, the works.
Jimbo! Ha haaaaa. Ah.
Temporary workspace. You can use it.
Nope, you cannot use it.
You can use the conference room as a temporary workspace.
Ah, none. You're picking a health care plan.
Thank you, Oh, gah, here we go again. Gotta go, I have to take this.
I have to make a call after I finish... my work. You know what? Uh, just don't let anybody in my office under any conditions today. I'm just too busy. Too swamped, you know? I am unreachable. I am incommunicado, capisce?
Oh, I am in my office. I am swamped. I have work up to my ears I'm busy, busy, busy. Can't step away. I just wanted to check in and see how everybody's doing. Everybody cool out there?
Pam, Michael Scott. How's tricks?
OK? All right. Do we feel good? All right. Good. Plus, there's some other good news. Today, at the end of the day, I will have, for all of you, a big surprise. OK? So hang in there, and I will see you at the end of the day. Right?
Cuts? What? Wow, Dwight, did you make cuts?
Is it a good plan?
Ah, what? Which memo?
Ah, uh, I would love to, but I am really busy. Rain check?
Um, headed out. Part of my busy day, you know. Meetings.  Couldn't find the knob.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I did, so...
Uh, all right. Well, once you get down into the mine, what... you got laser tag or something?
So it's not a free fall?Man on P
Its says here that it's a 300ft drop.Man on P
Uh, nope. Nope. This isn't the surprise. It's surprising, um... because you didn't expect it. But you will... you'll know it when you see it.
There you go.
Why don't you just eat it, OK? And here you go, Stanley the manly.
All right, I have some news for you. There is a big surprise. And... here it is. Here we go. And the big surprise is... Brrrrrrrr! Drum roll... Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrr!
Oh... Yes. Exactly. Thank you Angela, for reminding me. Terrific. Um, before I tell everybody what the big surprise is, would you like to tell me what you think the big surprise is?
Oh come on! That's horrible! Aaah... Thanks, Dwight, for a crappy plan. Ah, Damn! Oh, mmm, I wish I had time to change it, but Jan needs it by five, and... what time is it, what time is it?  Ah, it's after five. Oh, oh it's awful. So, well, OK. See you guys on Monday.
Uh, Dwight? Did you raise benefits?
Well, what? You could be referring to anything.
Mmm, mm, mm. Maybe.
But there's no downsizing, so just don't...
Look, look, look. I talked to corporate, about protecting the sales staff. And they said they couldn't guarantee it if there's downsizing, okay?
Assistant to the regional manager Dwight.
There's no downsizing.
Oh! God. Dwight, come on...
Brrrp! Uh, Spock, are there any signs of life down there? Well, let me check Captain. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. Eeee. No, Captain. No signs of life down here. Just a wet blanket named Pam. Brr-rrrp. Star Trek.
Yeah, why not? Sure. Go ahead, live a little. Come on, Pam. Come on, shake it up. Shake it up! Shake it up!
Um... uh, OK. Well, great, well, you know, it'll be a surprise.
Yes! All right, come on down Meredith!
Next person on the...
Who is it? Who's the birthday?
Mint chocolate chip! That'd be good, how about some, mint chocolate chip?
So I was thinking, if you haven't already got a cake, um, maybe going for one of those ice-cream cakes from Baskin-Robbins. Those are very good. Very Delicious.
Oh, my gosh, well... Listen, Oscar, generosity and togetherness and community all convalescences into... morale. That's what I say, so...
No, I'm always good... for some serious buckage. Wow. Two dollars, three dollars? People out here do not care about diseases. I am going to give you... $25.
Oh, God. Of course I would. Get it over here. Get that over here.
Oh, not at all. Come on in. What's going on?
Hey, Oscar! Come on in. What's up?
You know what, I am on a deadline here, and just... OK. Thanks, thanks for your help. I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight. That was a waste of time.
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
Which one is that again?
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
Almost there. Just a sec. Just a second. It is perfect, thank you. Excellent, here we go. It is time, thank you. OK, come on. Let's go! Get the cake. Here we go. Come on! Shhh. Be quiet.
Find a key.
It's surprise Meredith. One, two...
And many more!
You know what? If I were allergic to dairy, I think I'd kill myself. 'Cause this is way, way too good.
Oh, right. God, too bad. It's so good.
Come on. A little bit.
You looked freaked, man. We said "Surprise." You were, like, "What?" "What the hell's goin' on here?" Good cake. Why don't you have some?
You were surprised, weren't you?
Is Oscar around?
Well, you know, money isn't everything Jim. It's not the key to happiness. You know what is? Joy. You should remember that. Maybe you'll give more than three dollars next time.
Son of a bitch. That is impressive.
How many miles did he do last year?
No, no, no, no, no. That wasn't what I wasn't, that wasn't... No. It-it-it's not about the money. It's just... it... it's the ethics of the thing, Oscar. How's your nephew? Is he in good shape?
Right. Got it. Yes. So it does. Um...
Per mile, yes.
OK, we... all right. People, hold on, hold on. Just a second. OK, I think we're losing sight of what is really important here. And that is that we are... a group of people... who work together. I was... I really wasn't gonna flaunt this. I have made a very sizable donation to Oscar's nephew's... walkathon. $25.
This isn't my fault. Ladies, not your best effort. The streamers?  I think we could have done better than that.
That wasn't even mine. I got that off the Internet. Website. Um, don't get mad at me.
"She's so old, she went into an antique store and they kept her."
Everybody? If... could do it? "Meredith is so old..."
Divorce. Um... OK, "Meredith is so old..."
You didn't get the joke. So, that's cool. That's, you know what? Actually... I have a bunch of these, good ones, that I didn't use. Um... Oh, where's that? Oh, OK, here's a good one. Um... "Hey Meredith, Liz Taylor called, she wants her age back and her divorces back." 'Cause Meredith's been divorced like, twice. Is that right?
Because of the downsizing. Rumors. And because you're gettin' old.
Huh! Thanks, downer.
I don't know about that.
Read it out loud. And say who wrote everything so we know whose is the best.
Come here.  Don't cash that till Friday, OK?
There's not going to be downsizing, Dwight. You know what, I am on a deadline here and just, okay. Thanks. Thanks for your help. I'm... I'll work it out. Thank you Dwight.  Thanks for coming in, that's always... Always helpful when I give him a call. Call him in.
No, not a uterus joke Dwight. Please. Something useable. A joke.
Help me out here.
Come up with a joke that I can use, okay?
Oh God! Dwight, no. I'm trying to write something funny here, okay. What am I going to do with a removed uterus?
Which one is that again?
I know all that. I know all that. I just, I need something kind of embarrassing, you know. Kind of fun, inside.
There's not going to be downsizing Dwight, OK? I just, I need to know a little bit more about my friend.
Uh, yeah. What do you know about Meredith?
All right, all right, secret sign. Hey, Ryan.  Very good. Excellent, excellent. D
No, it's not. It's lower, so... D
Yes it is. Assistant to  the regional manager.
Good. Excellent, it'll be fun. Because corporate, uh, wants someone to be here on Saturday. And so we're going to have to have some people come in on the weekend, and I know nobody's gonna want to do it and I know everybody's gonna complain and bitch and I don't want to have to deal with that.
I vouched for you in front of Todd Packer, Dwight.  All right, here's what I'm going to do. The hand strikes and gives a flower. You are not going to play basketball. But I need somebody to come in and take over the holiday and weekend work calendar.
I vouched for you.
When I let him come to my pick-up game...
No. And that's not me being mean, Dwight. That is based on your past behavior.
You still getting it regular man? Huh? I mean, I can tell her it's part of the job!  Rapport!
And that is Lonny. And this is Roy. Roy dates Pam. You know, the uh, the best looking one upstairs.
No, it's Darryl. Darryl is Mista Ra-jahs.
And this is the foreman. Mista Ra-jahs.
And here we have "Mister Roger's Neighborhood." Come on over here. Hey, this is Ryan. He's temping upstairs.
All right, see you at one.
Oh, well, I'm glad that some time is a busy time because whenever I'm down here it doesn't seem too busy to me. Oh, oh. You can dish it out, but you can't take it. OK, fine, have it your way.
Oh, I see, you're chickening out on me. You're bailing on me.
Jim, you're in charge of the vacation schedule now.
No, I am the team manager. You can be assistant to the team manager.
No, I'm team captain.
Close. All right, uh... Me, Stan the man, Jim, Ryan and Dwight.
No, no, ridiculous.
I will use your talents come baseball season, my friend. Or if we box.
Yes, this is business. The, uh, business of team building and morale boosting. Uh, who else?
Um... Yeah. Who else? We have Jim. We have Ryan, the new guy, right? Untested. Willing to prove himself now. A lot of passion, a lot of heart.
Well, people hear a lot of things, man. Um... other starters... Me, of course. I heard it that time.
Uh, I don't know. I don't remember saying that.
Um, what do you play? Center?
OK, so, let's put together a starting line-up, shall we? Stanley of course.
Uh,  "I'll help, Elwyn Dragonslayer, uh, ten points, power sword."
Nerd. That is why you're not on the team.
I... yeah, yeah. I know, grumble, grumble. But you would follow me to the ends of the earth, grumbling all the way. Like that, uh, dwarf from Lord of the Rings.
Oh, yuck, that's worse than you playing. ... 'Cause we need you as an alternate in case somebody gets hurt. That's where we need you. Blessed be those who sit and wait. You made it, suit up, you're on the team! All right, cool! Very good.
Oh, yeah right.
Yeah, I bet you would. Just try not to be too gay on the court. And by gay I mean, um, you know, not in a homosexual way at all. I mean the uh, you know, like the bad-at-sports way. I think that goes without saying.
Oh, Pam with a zinger. Hey, Pam, how would you, like to be our cheerleader today? You know, some, ah, pigtails? A little, ah, halter top, you could tie that up. And you know, something a little, just, youthful, for a change. Just this once?
OK. Cool, you're on.  Don't screw this up.
Whoa-ho. I like the way you think. You know what, I'm gonna take that one step further. Loser, works, on Saturday.
Oh ho, oh, he's running. He's running. He's running, but he can't hide because you know what? One o'clock, you better bring your 'A' game. Because me, and my, posse guys are gonna be in your face. Right in your face!
All right, everybody stretch out a little bit. Stretch it. Full stretch. Ryan, you wanna stretch?
Who's got Roy?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Over here, over here.  Let's go to the zone! We're going to zone!
Stanley!  What? You gotta be kidding me! !?!  Who's on him? Somebody get him!
Yes. Uh, Pam? You kind of have your foot in both camps, why don't you do the uh, jump ball OK?
On. Just put it on.
Aw, come on Dwight.
Actually, I think Roy is their best player not Lonny. So, Dwight, you uh, have the East German gal. Uh, who else we got... Um...OK, all right, you guys.
OK, I'll take it.  OK.
That is cool. Is that like the Robot?
You know what? Dwight, Dwight...
Come on! Hey, Dwight. Dwight!
All right, switch. Take it up a notch, come on.
What's going on? What's going on? You're playing like a bunch of girls.
All right, time, time out. Come on, sales, over here. Bring it in! Come on!
Ouch! Oh, how much does it hurt? How much does it hurt?
You guys believed me? Come on. Dogs, you know, you should know me better than that. No, oh, do you think that would've been good for morale? No. No. No. Exactly, no. I'm embarrassed it was even that close though. So... nah, of course, we're coming in Saturday. Good game. Word.
Um... well, you guys, you know, I'm the boss so...
It was us? Really? I didn't, I didn't know. Great, I mean, I guess you guys are working Saturday. Your face.
Well, let's just say whoever was ahead won.
Game over. Game over. That is it! I'm sorry, you know? I hate to do it this way but, you know, that's just... we're having a friendly game. It's a shame. This is a damn shame, but we're like a family here and that just, that won't fly.
Yes, it was. You know what, I'm just being fair.
No, no, no, no. That was a flagrant, personal, intentional foul. Right there.
What's your problem man? Gah, just clocking me for no reason?
Oh, that hurts.
Ow! God! Hold it!
Yeah, baby, here we go!
Come on. Let's not be gloomy here man. We're all in this together. We're a team. You know what? Screw corporate, nobody's coming in tomorrow. You have the day off. Like coming in an extra day is gonna prevent us from being downsized. Have a good weekend.
You just said, let me uh... check my notes.  You just said... J
And shake! What? Go ahead. P
And fries! P
Burger with cheese!  P
Tah, come on Dwight. Just help me out here. That's just stupid. P
Oh, look. Oh hey, no catfights you two. I'm  against violence in the workplace. D
So if you need anything else, something to make you more confortable just don't hesitate to ask. I'm right here. K
Oh, um, well, we could have Ryan take a look. Ryan, would you look after the purses, please? R
Oh hey, I want to show you something. Come here I want to show you something.  I know you are going to like this. Picked it up today. A thousand big ones. K
Seriously. No, really.  K
Where you going? Nearby? Because I can give you a ride.
She asked me for a ride and so I am going to give her a ride home. D
No, no, no it's not against the rules.  She's not a permanent employee so it's not. D
Okay. Like he's going to win anyway, right?
Yeah, yeah, of course. Uh, Pam, one more thing. Um, how do girls your age feel about futons?
Yes you did. Yes, you did. Just checkin'. Just checkin', double checkin', checkin' on the check. Thoroughness is very important in an office and...
Would you like to help me with a special project? R
Take it easy. J
Don't drink and drive.
Alright, have fun.
Gyaaah. T.M.I. T.M.I my friends.
Yes we should. I... you know what?  I wanted one of those skillets of cheese, but when I got off stage,  someone had eaten all of them.
W-why did you...
Oh, no you di-int.
...a little bit of Roooy eating chicken crispers... ...a little bit of Jim with some ribs, a little bit of...
...a little bit of Phyllis everywhere...
Well, I think a lot of people were very affected by the footage.
Okay, no, that was a FUN raiser. I think I made that very clear in the fliers, fun, F-U-N.
...it happens once every billion years.
No reason?! It was the 05 05 05 party...
Well, yeah, I mean, what is...
You're dropping an A-Bomb on me here.
...come on, Jan!
Um, what, ah, what is, I mean...
Yeah, I'm here, I just wanted to, uh, talk to you for a second about that.
Wuh... Come on, Jan. This is important. I mean, this is, this is, validation to my employees here that you and corporate approve of this. So...
Well, you could take the bus.  You could work on the way here. Sleep on the way home.
Yeah, oh, hope not! Oh God!
Thank you Roy. Are there any words you'd like to say, on Pam's behalf?
Whoooo! When is that girl gonna get married? That's what I have to say. Ah, Roy's accepting.
Oh,  lazy. Uh huh.
That's why it's funny. Every year that Roy and Pam don't get married, it gets funnier.
Just STAP IT YAP IT!!!!
Just don't, don't talk-
Okay, well, that's just ridiculous, so just don't, I-I don't have time for this right now.
Yeah, not bad, right? So let's make this the best Dundies ever.
Alright, alright, joke landed. So we are here, thank you all for coming to the 2005 Dundie awards.  I am your host, Michael Scott. And I just want to tell you please, please, do not drink and drive. Because you may hit a bump and spill the drink!
Well, I'm looking forward to meeting Terri.
I did. And why didn't ya Stanley?
Nope, actually this year, ah, no group tab, we're going to be doing separate checks.
...when she made me fill out six hours of paperwork-
And I was about to take her bra off...
No, that...for the sake of the story. And things were getting hot and heavy.
Well, we'll fix it up. You don't have to display that.
What? I told them busiest...idiots.
Yeah, way to go Phyllis. Nice work, per usual.
...the "Busiest Beaver" award goes to Phyllis Lapin.
Herro everybodeeee. I'm gonna cwall Jan Revinson-Gould.
Right? You know wat I'm talking 'bout.
Yeah.  "Hidy ho, you sexy thang. You sexy thang you." Here you go.
Somebody, who I think a lot of us, cannot keep, from checking out. The "Hottest in the Office" award goes to... ...Ryan the temp!
Just sit down Kelly.
I know. It's ju- they didn't have any more businessmen. So...
Um, not everything means something, it's just a joke.
Hey, thanks guys. Hey, where you guys from?Other Guy at B
There you go.
This last Dundie is for Kevin, this is the "Don't Go in There After Me" award. It's for the time that I went into the bathroom after him, and it was really, really smelly. So...
Let's cut it.
Guy At B
Uh, you know what guys, we're just having a little office party, so if you want, uh...
You know you did.
Alright, alright, alright, okay. Alright, we'll keep rolling. Okay, this is the fine work award. This goes to Stanley, for all the fine work he did this year.
It is the "Whitest Sneakers" award! Because she always has the whitest tennis shoes on!
...I think we all know what award Pam is going to be getting this year.
Pam Beesley ladies and gentleman.  Oh! Thank you.
Yes, that too, but I mean with the audio. Great work.
Well, neither of you are Chinese, so what... Why do you care?
Really? Well, he is based on the Chinese delivery guy that I have, who talks exactly like that, so, I think you should take it up with him instead of me.
Ping? Everybody loves Ping. He's my most popular character.
Yeah, all the homies
You down with the Dundies?
You down with the Dundies? You're all my h
You down with the Dundies?
No? Um... Check your spam folder.
Any emails today?
Uh oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho-o!
Oh, Boom! Bam! Oh, this guy is out of control! He is a madman! Better get the bleep button ready for him.Todd P
Kay! Oh, you are so bad! Yeah!Todd P
Yeah... maybe. Maybe. Well, we'll see. Because I... I don't know if it's...  Whup! Come on! Hey!Todd P
Um, I... D
Oh, wow! What did I tell you about the bleep button.
Oh! Wow! I didn't say it! I didn't say it!Todd P
Oh, yeah.Todd P
Really? Here we go! Buckle up. It's going to be a bumpy one!Todd P
Ah! Man. That Todd Packer can do anything.
Oh. Bad boy. Todd P
Um... literally two seconds?
Forward it like it's hot. Forward it like it's hot. "Old School".
There is no such thing as an appropriate joke. That's why it's a joke.
It is a big deal. It's a big deal! What are we supposed to do? Scrutinize every little thing we say and do all day? I mean, come on!
No, no, Toby. No.
I wish you luck, Toby. I really do. But you are going to have a mutiny on your hands and I just can't wait to see how you handle it.
Well, not exactly what I was looking for but thanks guys.Warehouse g
No, I don't.
Oooh, okay. That was still about me.
Alright, alright. Well, yeah, but, you know... a joke but not necessarily at my expense.
Um, yeah, no, well... I mean better. Better than that. The type of stuff you guys tell all day. D
Yes, she was. Dammit, Kevin!
She would have definitely slept with me.
No! No! Catherine. Remember her? Remember how hot she was? D
I think the old honor system was just fine. For example, I have never slept with an employee. And, believe me, I could have.
Give me a break. Umm... Stanley, how about that hot picture you have by your desk? Centerfold in the Catholic schoolgirl's outfit? I mean, it is hot, it is sexy, and it turns him on. And I will admit, best part of my morning is staring at it. But what? Are we just going to take it away?
Exactly! Mmwwah ! Can we afford to lose email forwards? Do we want that?
Did he tell you everything? Obviously, he didn't because you all still look relatively happy. Albeit bored. Do you realize what we're losing? Seriously?
I know, I know. It's good. It is not over. It is not over til it's over.
Okay. Well, then let's act it out. Pam, you will be girl A and girl B will be... Okay! We'll use the doll. Pam. Pam?
What if they made out? In front of everybody?
That's what she sai   Nope, but... Okay. Well, suit yourself.
That's what she said. Pam?
I wish Todd Packer was here because he would love this. I wonder if anybody else would like to do this. Hey! Um... we have to watch, uh, Toby's video that he's showing us in order to brainwash us and I was wondering if anybody would like to join in? Going to be fun. Got my great pizza. Whataya say? Jim?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... Okay! Hypocrite! She is a hypocrite. That is such a scam! Okay.
Okay, you are never going to believe this. The girl in the video we're watching that Corporate gave us... Darryl banged her! Aaand is about 90% sure.
Well, it's probably because you don't get 'em.
No, I didn't.
No, I've seen the video.
Mwah! Todd P
So I'm not in trouble?
This guy does it all.
Okay.  Jan. Mr. O'Malley. This is my lawyer, James P. Albiny.
It's... That's... J
I know. We'll talk about it later. Thanks for coming in.
You know what? The only thing I'm worried about... is getting a boner. Good work today, everybody.
They didn't get to me. I got to them. I am still the same old Michael Scott. New and improved. You know what? I love Phyllis. You know what else? I think she is gorgeous. I think she is incredibly, incredibly attractive person.  C'mere, c'mere, c'mon!  Come on! Come on.
Yes, your corner. Go.
Well, I have a late birthday and usually September's a cut-off point.  You know what? You just crossed the line. Okay? There's a line and you went over it. And you must be punished. So go to your corner.
I don't know about that.
No. You said it. He pointed. A point is not a say. Look. Kevin, we are a family here and Phyllis is a valued member of that family. Like a grandmother.
Not you. Kevin. Just unwarranted. Hostile work environment, Kevin.
No. No, no, no. That crosses the line.Todd P
Um. The sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit. But thank you. And why don't you take a couple hours. The office is yours. "Home Alone," "Risky Business." Take your pants off, run around. Whatever you gotta do.
Yummy, yummy. Thank you, Ryan.
Yes it is. Yes it is. It is very important to own property. Back in olden days, they would not even let you vote unless you owned property and they'd throw you in the stocks and humiliate you.
As my associate.
Ok. Fine. Yes, you can come.
Except that, this is about my living arrangement, and as boss, I need to have a living arrangement in order to do work.
No. Dwight. I'm fine.
I don't need a representative.
Uh, I don't need one.
Sign the papers at the condo.
Yes. Yes. Final walkthrough. D
Ok. See you soon.
NO, well can you get on that, because I don't just read Cracked.  Thank you. P
How about, uh, Fine Arts? Aficionado Monthly?
Maxim? American Way? Cracked?
Good. The Small Business Man?
We will. Um, did you do the thing I asked you to do about the magazines?
We are. Dwight and I are going to the big thing. So why don't you have everybody work on their expense reports and I'd like them in by the end of the day.
I do not understand what you spend your money on.
I don't know, regular. Normal ones. Nothing fancy. Not my style. What are you doing?
Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait...  no, it's this one, right here. Home, sweet home.
Yeah, small. I'm buying it and I'm not renting it. So, it's still an upgrade. He doesn't know anything about property ownership. Kind of an idiot. Um.
Nice to meet you too. D
Oh, how are you? Nice to meet you, Bill. Bill. Mr. Bill. OHHH NOOO. MR. BILL. OHHH! SNL? When they pull him apart? He'd always get rolled over by something. B
Oh. Good. That's good. It's good to be accommodating of that. D
So that's the problem, is solved. What?
I'm putting my bed right over here.
Um. I'm going to take a little breather for a second. Excuse me. D
Ok, ok, ok. D
Uh... Ten year. C
As far as I can tell, I'm the best-looking person here.
Where are all the hot people? I was told that there would be all these attractive singles.
I am not going to rent the third bedroom. I want a price reduction or I am a-walkin. C
No, no. I insist. I insist. Because you've really done some great work. Great work. And that is why, I am going to let you move into my third bedroom and pay me rent.
What the hell is a terrarium?
I'm thinking, lock into a four year commitment, we'll go month to month after that. Or, until I start dating, have a girlfriend, then you're, you know, you're gone. D
EHHHHNT. Game over. Offer revoked. Dwight. I'm sorry, but you reach out and you try to be a nice guy, and help out a friend, and this is what happens. This is what I get. Oh god. I'm ... Ok.
Why would we do that?
We take separate cars.
Yeah, well, you know what? Nobody cares about your stupid beet farm. Beets are the worst.
Yeah. Jim. Slim Jim. What's going... What's going on?
Oh.  What the hell is that?
I don't really know what to say. Um, I'm not one for making speeches, but ah, my heart is very full at this moment. J
Stop. Dwight. You know what? You're acting like a dork. Would you cool it? Please. Okay. Hey! He's not your five year old brother, Dwight. He's a valued member of this company... and you know what? He knows more about business than you ever will. D
How long does it take to find a cell phone? I don't know either.
Dwight!? Great goin'. God, Man! Why did you go in there? What... Everybody was scared out of their wits, man? Oooh.
Okay! I'm sorry.
I'll call her back.  Wish I could fire Sherri.
If you were getting fired, how would you wanna be told so you could still be friends with the person firing you?
I don't know... yet. I will have to call her back.
Well, I'm gonna wait till the end of the day. Because the book said it's best to wait till the end of the day.
Hey, Sherri. Michael Scott returning.
I know. I sent away for it in July from a catalog.
And... sometimes you just let it go to voicemail.
No. Or a woman. A human life. If you had to guess, who it would be based on their job performance... and who you think deserved to be fired - who would that be?
You're worried about the party? There's a man's life at stake here.
Because it's very scary stuff.
Um, Pam, I have to let somebody go today. This is, uh, the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
Well, that's not what I'm saying. Just, you know, find it. Pretend that your jobs depend on it.
Good.  Oh, yeah, also about budget stuff. Um, I'm  going to need you to find, like a, a full employee salary, plus benefits, like fifty grand. I'm going to need you to find 50 grand in the numbers.
Well, you know what? Go buy some more. I'll approve the overages. Sound good?
All good. Happy Halloween. What happened to all those spooky decorations that we had? The cobwebs and such?
Oh, boy... look at you! Haha. Showing your colors. Bet you wish you wore a dress every day.
It's gonna be fun.
You guys excited about the party?
Yeah. That would be perfect.
"Bend It Like Beckham."
No, Jim brings in money.
I agree. He'd land on his feet.
Are you kidding?
That is not a very nice thing to say about him.
I'm not saying that's what he said.
Yeah... I could.
Yeah, that's actually a really good idea.
You're right, I didn't even think of him.
What? There was someone left off that list? Who?
I don't wanna fire Stanley. I never said that. I'm certainly not going to do it myself. Get those big, baleful, eyes staring at me. Yikes. Just, okay, just...
Wohahah! Why are you torturing me?! God.
You can call. Can you call 'em?
Big deal. Oh, it would've worked out so well. Can you get it back?
If you left, I wouldn't have to fire anybody.
What?! That would've solved all my problems.
Can I speak to you a minute?
I'm gonna kill you. I'm going to kill you for firing me.
And I'm very angry, and I want... J
I'm improvising, so just try to keep up.
I... this is Creed.
Corporate is really breathing down my neck. And they're saying this has to be done by the end of the month.
I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault!
No, no, no. That's just the first thing... came... in head.
I want you to be me, and I will be Creed.
I want you to role play firing me. I want you to fire me, and I will take it.
Could I talk to you for a second?
I don't... okay, just listen.
I can't change anything. This is the way... C
I can't, I can't... C
It's right here on the desk, yeah.
What old days? What are you talking about?
No, of course  you can't go. We haven't even started this horrible process of... okay, Creed. I need to let somebody go today. They told me I need to let somebody go. And as much as I think you're a great guy, and I like you, you're... you're, goodbye.
I think you're right.
Why... why are you making this so hard?
No, you wanna leave.
I... we're gonna have to... You... you want something better.
Okay, well... I already picked you. And you know that. So, unless I just go through with this, you're always gonna look at me as the guy who almost fired you.
I just hope that you and I can remain friends.
No. It was all the stuff that I said. It was the business downturn, the cutbacks, and, and... D
Huh. No! I can't, no. I can't go back. I would look like an idiot.
Well, maybe I did.
Well, he... D
Look, look. In addition to severance, and everything, I want to give you this gift certificate to Chili's. From me. Okay? No hard feelings.
You're a lion.  Oh, okay, that's all yours. That's all yours. Grab it, grab it. You know what? You guys are getting all of these.
A fairy princess. You're very... .
You look great! And you're a princess?
He... Hey, hey, hey, hey! How you doing? Wow! You guys looks great.
Oh, shoot. Okay, well, just have your pepper spray ready.Hank the Security G
I don't know. Hey, are you on our payroll or are you employed by the building?Hank the Security G
Catch-22. Yes. Why don't you give me your contact information to start with, ok, what's your cell?
Chillax, Pam. Stop Pam-M-S-ing. That's pretty good. Um, actually, I'm sending Ryan on a top secret mission. Tell her what it is.
Hello, oh God, busy work. Ahh, get away, cretin.
Uhh, yes, I did, here's the dizzle. I have a very top secret mission for you. I want you to update all the emergency contact information.
This is Tito. R
Hey Ryan. This is Michael Jackson calling from Wonderland.
This is Mike Tyson.
They told me. After. You see, I used to run with a very tough crowd. Street Fighter types. Real, real bad people, I'm just lucky I got out.
Because I would kick his ass. J
Yes, in theory, I have. I just need to cross some t's and dot some i's. Alright, I'm going to be in my office if anybody needs me.  Hoo-hah. Oh, wow, sleeper hold. That's my rebuttal. Shhh. Hoo. You are the weakest link. D
Ok, here we go. Alright, come on.
... he cried at the end of it. He did.
Look, Dwight is a wuss. When we rented 'Armageddon'... D
Oh, queer...  eye. Queer eye. That's a good show. Important show. Go ahead. Do it.
Yeah.  Thank you.
I've got an i
No, they must have class. D
You know what? You're just lucky that we are at work right now.
Look, if we were in a bar right now, there would be two p
Really? Well, the offer, Dwight, was for one punch which I absorbed. I had no idea that there would be a second punch. So, catch-22. D
Watch out Kelly, he might sucker punch you.
Ok, alright, where is Dwight? J
Oh, I could beat up Dwight. That's ridiculous. I could murder him. P
Come in. Um, Pam, I hate to break this to you but Dwight can't stop you from being mugged. He's just not tough enough. P
I haven't signed them, ok?
Open your mouth. D
You can't see. You can't see. Good boy. Good boy. Great boy. Two points, three points, four points. I win. I win.
Go on, I dare you to kick there again. Kick there again, I dare ya.
Play dirty, huh? Ok, game on, man. K
Alright, that's the way you want it. D
What the hell was that?
Alotta rules. Alotta rules. On the street we didn't have any rules. Maybe one - no kicks to the groin, home for dinner. I
He is such a sore loser. You heard, obviously, that I mopped the floor with him this afternoon. You know what, um, do yourself a favor and just keep me as his contact and I will call the hospital. Cut out the middle man.
Yeah... uh, come in. Oh, hey Karate Kid. The Hillary Swank version. Hi. How are ya? D
This close. Dwight, may I speak with you for a minute?
Yes you do. D
Absolutely but not really. D
No, no. Three month probationary period. Let's not tell anybody about this right now.
No, no, title change only. D
And I am happy to say that you have passed. So effective immediately I am promoting you from Assistant to the Regional Manager to Assistant Regional Manager. D
Uh huh, uh huh.  Power trip.
It will.  I sent it in.  Letter to the editor.
Here's the thing. Chili's is the new golf course.  It's where business happens.  Small Businessman Magazine.  J
Radisson just gives out this vibe, "Oh, I'm doing business at the Radisson".  It's kind of snooty.  So.
I changed it.  To Chili's.
No, no.  That would not be efficient.  Actually, they just don't get very much work done when I'm not here.   Adios!
Dar de dar.
You ever been to Scranton, Jan? Dar de-
It's just a couple blocks away, so... boy, you really don't know Scranton, do you?
Uh, I'll drive.
Well, I... it could be either of us.
Well, in case one of us gets into trouble, the other one can signal-
Alright, after you.
When did this happen?
Wow, you're kidding me!  Do you wanna talk about?
Is Gould dead?  What uh-
Uh, Jan, what happened?
Thought that was you.  Hi.  Michael Scott.  This is Jan Levinson-Gould.
Just one joke.  Ok.  Well, if it's just gonna be one, I will think of a different joke.  Umm... let's see... choo choo choo.
Very very funny joke the other day.  Wanna hear it?
I heard a-
Ok, it's done. Actually,  Megan, may we have an Awesome Blossom, please, extra awesome?  Now it's done.
I think we should share an Awesome Blossom, what do you say?   They are awesome. Want to, Christian, blossom?
Pam, it's Michael.  I need you to go into my office and check some data for me.
Oh ho ho, yea!  Bingo! And a lighthouse.  Yes.  That is hysterical.  Could you start that one from the beginning?
Nope.  Told it.  Not as good as you think.  Pick another one.
Bop! Be blah bop, be boo boo bop.
Chili's baby back ribs...
Michael and C
No, you were not stupid.  Gould was stupid.  Right?
She's not playing the game.
Oh, so you're not gonna play?  She's not playing.
Woo, well, this brings us to Jan.  Truth or Dare?  Tell us about your divorce. Ohh, ohh.
Well, corporate's gonna go ballistic, but, uh, you think we could Jan?
It, you know what, it really is.
Uh huh, Kenneth Road, born and raised.  Spent my whole life right here in Lackawanna County and I do not intend on movin'.  I know this place.  I know how many hospitals we have, I know how many schools we have.  It's home, you know?  I know the challenges this county's up against.  Here's the thing about those discount suppliers.  They don't care.  They come in, they undercut everything, and they run us out of business, and then, once we're all gone, they jack up the prices.
Goin'. Ok.  Where we goin'?  Doesn't matter.  Goin' to the go go.  Oh-ok.
Nailed it.  Nailed it!  Come here.
We did it!
And she is a woman.  She is a strong, soft, thoughtful, sexy woman.  And you know what?  I don't think that I can sit here and let you talk about her that way without me defending her honor.   Is that all?
This is none of your affair because she is your boss-
Uh, no, no, no Gould.
And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.  "Michael, it's Jan. I guess I missed you.  I'll, uh, be there this afternoon for performance reviews.  I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion. See you soon."  First impressions?
And a woman-
Oh, wow, wow.  Alright, let's listen to that again.  "Michael, it's Jan.  I guess I missed you".
Ah, why, that's great news?   That, that, then why would, why would I not like that?
Ohhh, great.  Well, now I'm in a terrible mood.  Let's do your performance review-
Ok. Yeah, what, what?
But then she goes on to say "that will be our only topic of discussion".  That doesn't mean anything, those are just words.
God, Stanley, that's frickin' brilliant. How do you know that?  Did you learn that on the streets?  Sorry.
Oh; Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.
They are not.  Yes, they are.   That's my girlfriend.
Um, I don't see how that's unprofessional. Just-
Been thinking about you.
Well, surely this uh, review is a formality because of what happened uh, at our meeting in the parking lot of Chili's.
Well, hello to you, too.  Um, yeah, I was just um, I just wanted to get some closure on uh, what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.
Jan!  To what do I owe this pleasure?
What did I say?
Why don't you find it and tell people to get theirs... never mind, I'll tell them.  Hello, everybody?  Yeah, uh, attention, please.  Jan Levinson's coming, very soon, and so, we're going to have our weekly suggestion box meeting, so you can all get your constructive compliments in a.s.a.p.
The suggestion box that I put out, and people could be put in suggestions anonymously?  Maybe there's prizes?
That's unfortunate.  How 'bout the suggestion box?  There's tons of ideas in there.
Yep, right after you.  Apres-vous.  No calls.
Ok.  Ok, why don't we just step into my office?  We're gonna go in here.
Good to see you.
Hi, Jan.  How are you?
It's nice to see you.
Well, you're wearing it at the office. And  it, I'm sorry, but no offense, but it's really sexy.
Are you wearing a new perfume today?
This is a business question. It's nothing personal, I promise.
No, no, no, I finished all of that.  I'm very fast.  I'm not too fast.  Not like wham-bam-thank ya ma'am.  But I do say thank ya ma'am.  But, I'm, I'm not like wham-bam.  Not that there's anything wrong with wham-bam.  If it's consensual.    We're talking about office stuff.  Can I ask you a question?
No, it's in like ten minutes.
I did not, not, not use those words.
I'm kind of in the middle of something. I wish you wouldn't interrupt.
"Don't sl-", ok, that's blank  Don't, just put it-
Yeah, what? Uh, alright, next suggestion.
Let's keep going.  Keep it going.  Yep.  What do we have here?  We have somebody's piece of gum.  Somebody put a piece of gum in there.  This is not a, a garbage can, this is the future of our company.  This is not a place for gum.  I don't wanna have to read these tomorrow.
I'll work on that-
Yeah, is that hard for you?  Alright, well-
Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight, OK. I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.
Was I, Creed?!  Ok, well, you know what? I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs, because talk about stank.  Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will. I just think it's something that we should all be aware of.  Ok?  Now that we've learned this, let's continue.  See, this is good, we're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.  "You need to do something about your coffee breath"-
Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.O., then I would say that is a very poor choice of words.
Ok, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion and it's not an office suggestion.  Far be it for me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.
Arrr, dooby dooby do. "You need to do something about your B.O."
Oh, that guy?  That guy was weird.  Alright, next suggestion.
Tom.  Then it is a joke because there is nobody in here named Tom.
Oh, ok, well, yeah, who wrote it?
And, um, one down.  Next s
Well, obviously this one got stuck in the box.  That happens occasionally.
Let me ask you something.
Ok, let me ask you this.
Let me ask you-
I don't understand why you're so upset.
Ok. You just, uh, clear your head.
What do you say, Jan?
Oh, did not!
Ok, third wheel, why don't you do that?
That is a serious offense. Very serious.  As is toying with a man's heart.
You do?  How do you get in?
Why on earth would we give you a raise?
You wanna talk now, good; OK, Dwight, leave.  D
Ok, great.  Your performance has been adequate.  You may leave; goodbye.
What do you want Dwight?
Oh my God... D
So my looks have nothing to do with it?
No, I wasn't, I didn't cry-
I appreciate that, thank you.
Am I too short?
I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio?
Well, ok, well never as in 'never ever ever', or never as in there's still a chance?
Ok, so you're saying that there is a different time or place?
Wait, wait, wait, come, I just, I just wanna know why?
Never missed a day, my ass.
So, good, good, good. Something to work toward, being here more. I'm a big believer in people being here more.
Um, you're in accounting...
There's no time to think about if this is real.  Just, shh, everybody.
Oh... Sadiq (IT guy): What's your password, Michael? M
Uh, oh, ok; if I step on a mine in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and die, you can have my job, ok?  Why don't you just go... away?
I'm not going get a brain-
Dwight, nothing is going to happen to me, ok?  I'm in the best shape of my life.  Look at this.  Brrr!  That's strong!
I don't have to tell you anything.
I can't tell you.
Please don't do that.
Try "profits".  No! Try "Michael Scott".  "Michael" "boss" and "funny".   "Sorry I didn't write back sooner; I can't go to the game tonight because my boss Michael is an ass and making me stay late."  Well, Stanley's an ass.  Not one of our harder workers.
The problem is that when people hear the term "big brother", they immediately think it's scary or bad, but I don't. I think, wow, I love my big brother.
You know what the problem is?
Oh, what? No. That defeats the whole purpose.
Oh, no, everybody; Oscar's gone crazy!  What other ghost stories do you have for us?  That I'm a robot?   I will destroy everything in my path-
Yeah!  They were the most fun.  We always invited them.
Hot, tasty.  Reminds me of college.  Lived on this stuff.  Brain food.  Mmmm... You know what I really, really miss about college?  The parties.  Everybody'd go.  The athletes, the, the nerds, professors.
Of course.  Hangin' with my crew, crew that I am one of.  Hangin' with my Cup of Noodles.  This is a meal in a cup.
It is. Ok.
It's the best.  It's the best.  I would not miss it for the world.  But if something else came up, I would definitely not go.
Tonight, I can't do it tonight, no.  Improv class, I have improv class, hanging out with my improv buds-
I do, yeah. Big plans.
I do, too. I do, too. J
You have plans.
One more hour.  Take care of anything you forgot to do. Hey, you know, I don't know if you have any plans tonight, but if ya don't, we could hang out.
Almost quittin' time.
You, too, Dwight?
To watch t
That's, whatever stupid show you want-
Dwight, oh ho, Dwight, Dwight, my loyal compadre.  You and I are hangin' tonight.  The two of us.  We are celebrating our freedom and our manhood.  You know what?  Why don't we watch that show that you've been wanting to watch, that stupid Battleship Galaxy.
You are a liar.
Yeah, well duh.  Where ya headed?
Hey, Angela, rushy, rushy.  Where you rushin' off to?
Kevin, big man, big man, what are you doing tonight?  Where are you off to?
Alright.  Oscar, got big plans tonight with-
Ooo Ooo Ooo Ooo, Mr. Cart-air, Mr. Cart-air.Improv T
I could of-Improv T
Well, if you hadn't stopped the scene, you would have seen where it was going.Improv T
Why Improv T
Boom! Boom!Improv T
Boom!  Freeze!  Michael Scoon, FBI.  You know what you did.  Boom! Boom! Boom!   Boom! Boom! Boom!
Good, it's good.  Good work, everybody.
What are you... Improv T
No, no, no.  I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.
Right, right, right.  Well guys, I'd love to go to Bernie's with you, but, you know, I have an office party.  A big office party I need to go to, so...  Can't get out of it.
So Bernie's, huh?  We're all going to Bernie's?   Go to Bernie's?
We're making love!Michael and J
On three. Ready? Big, one, two, three.
Well, suck it up. We all have problems. Hey, everybody, look what we have!  Nice, huh?
You shove it. Shove it back! Here we go. Don't break the branches, Dwight.
You'll break it.
Here we are.
Well, that is a perfectly good mini-tree, Kevin. And we are going to sell that to charity. That's what Christmas is all about.
A, that's what she said, and B, I wanted it to be impressive. The biggest day of the year deserves the biggest tree of the year.
Double it. Double everything. Double ice cream. Double napkins. Double it. On me.
Yeah, I know. Damn it. Stupid corporate wet blankets. Like booze ever killed anybody.
That makes sense because he has elfish features.
Well, I'm sorry. It just doesn't work.
Have you ever seen Santa?
You wanna be Santa?
Yeah. I wanted this party to be really special so I sorta went above and beyond.
I spent a lot of dough. Lot of dough. Wow.
Yeah? Who did you have?
No, no. Shake it off, everybody. Just, let's do Secret Santa.
All right, let's count it down, like Rockefeller Center. Ready?
An oven mitt? Okay.
Oh hey, for me. What is in here?  Oh, come on.
What? Oh, shoot. Wow. Okay, well, who cares? It doesn't matter what I spent. What matters is that Christmas is fun, right?
You don't know that.
Whoa. Wow. Jeez. Somebody really got carried away with the spirit of Christmas. That was me, I got a little carried away.
Shut it. No, it's not. Okay, just give it a shot.
Because it's better. Because it's more special.
Well, I call it fun!
One person chooses a gift. The next person can either choose a gift or steal that person's gift. If your gift gets stolen, then you can steal somebody else's gift or choose a new gift.
I got it! We are going to turn Secret Santa into Yankee Swap.
I think this is going great.
Yankee Swap! That's what makes it fun. Pam, you can steal the oven mitt now.
Sucker! See, I wanted somebody to take it. Boom! Reverse psychology.
I hope nobody takes this baby, cause this is great. Wow, look at that fine craftsmanship. Somebody really put a lot of work into that. It's beautiful.
Who wants to take paintball lessons? How is that better than an iPod?
It wasn't. It wasn't that much. It was $3,000.
Well, I didn't. I got a big bonus because I fired Devon, and I used the money to buy something awesome. Sue me!
Come on! I think that Yankee Swap was a big hit! I think it's a success and I'm the one who ended up with Dwight's stupid paintball pellets.
Cool, cool. Box it up.
All right, now, you're the expert. Is this enough to get 20 people plastered?Liquor Store C
Go, here we go!
Zip it, Toby! Just .. I mean, it's a party. Come on. If I can't throw a good party for my employees, then I am a terrible boss. Who wants a drink?
This is Christmas spirit, as in spirits, booze.
Oh, no, no. No false modesty, my friend.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Kudos to Ryan, king of the party committee.
Oh, let's fix you up. Who wants to fix up .. Toby. Toby's gonna fix you up.
Oh, no, no. Oh look at that. Icing on the cake.Todd P
No way. Oh, you're kidding me. Packer! Yes! Todd Packer, ladies and gentlemen!Todd P
You're welcome.Todd P
Not bad. And if it couldn't go to Ryan, you are the guy I'd want it to go to.
Hey, Merry Christmas.
No, no, no, no. I really, really want you to have it.
Yeah, that sounds good.
Cool, cool, cool. Do you need a ride?  All right, let's head out. Sounds good. Do you have a coat?
Ah! Ha ha ha!
Well, no. But... okay, don't spoil it for everybody, all right? But we are going on a booze cruise on Lake Wallenpaupack.
Maybe, I don't know.
Maybe. The suspense is just so exciting, isn't it?
Be my mo manley.
Stanley! Bo banley.
Well, that's not my fault, okay? Just.. we're not going to pay for a bathing suit. Okay, I know what you're all thinking, "Who is this smart little cookie?" Her name is Brenda... something, and she is from corporate. And she is here, like you, to learn from what I have to say.
Well, just keep the tags on and you can return it.
To throw you off the scent.
Well, this... K
No. This is mandatory. But don't worry, you know what? You're gonna learn plenty. This is gonna turn your life around, Ryan.
No, I'm Leo DiCaprio! Come on!
All right, let's not get hung up on the furnace. This just... it's the sales... I see the sales department down there. They're in the engine room, and they are shoveling coal into the furnace, right? I mean, who saw the movie Titanic? They were very important in the movie Titanic. Who saw it? Show of hands!
Yes, Darryl, the sales department makes sales. Good. Let me just explain. I see the sales department as the furnace.
The... no, no. No, I didn't... okay. Well, okay, in a nutshell, what I'm saying is... leadership. We'll talk more about that on the boat. Ship.
No! Thank you, spoiler alert. You saw the movie, those of you who did. They're happy down there in the furnace room. And they're dirty and grimy and sweaty, and they're singing their ethnic songs, and... actually, that might be warehouse.
I'd rather die. Hi, I am Michael Scott, I am the captain of this party.Captain J
Hm? Okay. Yep.
We're all gonna have a good time tonight!Captain J
But don't worry, you are not going to be needing life preservers tonight.Captain J
And I am the regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin, Michael Scott. Welcome, welcome!Captain J
Well, we already sort of started it back at the office and on the dock with the Gilligan thing, so... right now, I was thinking. Yes. Okay, listen up all you Dunder-Mifflinites! I would like to talk to you all about life preservers. Now, one important life preserver in business is IT support.Captain J
Good. Well, that is what Scranton is all about. Not like you New Yawkers.
All right, we'll have a motivational dance contest! Hit it! Yeah, okay, dancing! It is a primal art form used in ancient times to express yourself with the body and communicate!
But before that, I have to do my presentation.Captain J
Okay, well, obviously you don't know anything about leadership.Captain J
No, no. Salesmen and profit centers.Captain J
Ah! See, this is of general interest. It is about priorities and making decisions, using the boat as an analogy. What is important to you? If the boat is sinking, what do you save?Captain J
Not what I was looking for, but a good thought.Captain J
Then I'll give you away!
Yes! I can marry you as regional manager of Dunder-Mifflin!
Well... could have been either one of us, because we were pretty much saying the same thing.  Congratulations. That is great!Captain J
It's a predicament, and it's something that each and every one of us has to think about.
Vomicillin. Okay. All right. It's time to be boss. It's time to motivate. Let's blow some minds here. Okay, guys, guys, cool it. Everybody, Dunder-Mifflin Scranton employees, Brenda, I have some very, very urgent news I need to tell everybody right now. Listen up. The ship is sinking! Okay? We're going down, right now. Just wrap your heads around the reality of that. Shh, please! Everybody, it's my turn now, okay? Captain Jack is gone. In five minutes, this ship is going to be at the bottom of the lake! And there aren't enough spaces on the lifeboat! Who are we gonna save? Do we save sales? Do we save customer service? Do we save accounting? This is a business scenario. Right? It's a scary... it's a... Captain J
Captain Jack is a fart face. I'm on medication.
Never, ever, ever give up.
BFD. Engaged ain't married.
Well, if you like her so much, don't give up.
Yeah? Yep. Well, Pam is cute.
Roy said the first one didn't count.
Well, it's nice for you. Your friend got engaged.
He just totally lost it. If you ask me, he caused the panic.
Captain Jack has a problem with authority.
It's a fake wheel, dummy.
Your problem now, Captain Jack.
That's my line! That's my line, That's... I always say that at weddings. So I'll just think of something else to say. I...
OK, buhhhh, I burned my foot very badly on my Foreman Grill and I now need someone to come and bring me into work.
OH GOD! J
I want to come to work.  But I need you to come and pick me up.
I am hurt. I hurt my foot.
No, I want you to pick me up.
I'm hurt, I have hurt myself.  Oh my God!
Pam! It's Michael.  Help me!  I need help right now.
Hellooo? ... Please don't send Dwight!
It was all made up.  Just someone come, ok?  Anyone.  Anyone but Dwight.
I don't have a girlfriend.
I don't want Dwight!
Don't... is that Dwight?  I do not want Dwight.  D
I'm not sick! I'm burned!
I tried hopping, Kevin, and I bumped my elbow against the wall and now my elbow has a protruberance. M
There's no toilet paper here.  Could Ryan... tell Ryan to bring toilet paper.  Could you tell 'em that?
Burned my foot, Pam.
Did you explain why?
Ha ha ha.  So where are you shipping...
Yes, you did.  What is wrong with you?
You just said "part of your duties are to" something.
What?  Part of your duties are to what?
No, I don't want some aspirin, yeah I'm a little fussy.  Aspirin's not gonna do a damn thing.  I'm sitting here with a bloody stump of a foot.
I don't want any special treatment, Pam. I just want you to treat me like you would some family member who's undergone some sort of serious physical trauma.  I don't think that's too much to ask.
No, your job is being my friend, Pam.  OW! God!
Really, well, it, uh, seemed very important to you earlier that you needed to stay and... P
How strange.  Because they always have yams.
And they had no yams?
Where are the yams?
Thank you.  Did you get all dark meat like I like?
Uh, ow.  Ryan! ... Ryaaaaan ... RYYYYAN!
Pam, please?  I have Country Crock.
I want you to rub butter on my foot.
Come here please.
Ugh, forget it.  I'll just get up myself.  No!  Uh, aaaahhh!  Ah!  Oh God!
I just saw him.
No, he's not. T
Get Ryan.  He needs to lift me.  and he needs to clean me up a little bit.  Bring a wet towel.
Ugh, not you.  Someone else.  Get Pam.
I fell off the toilet.  I'm caught between the toilet and the wall.
No! Guh! OW! Awww, help, help me!
I burned my foot!!!  Ok, twenty minutes, conference room, everybody's in there!
Shuuut it, ok, well, well you know what, disabilities are not things to be laughed at or laughed about.  You people are jerks.  Imagine if you had left Stevie Wonder on the floor of that bathroom instead of me.
Ok,  what does this look like to you Stanley?!  S
Wuh, how, how old are you? Look, the point is, I am the only one here who has a legitimate disability, although I'm sure Stanley has had his fair share of obstacles.  S
No, never heard of it.  No, a real disability, not a woman's trouble.
Well they notice it.  Don't you?  You notice it.  It's the first thing you saw when he rolled in here, isn't it?
Well, that's good, he still has a sense of humor.Billy M
Hey, hey, hey, not funny! Not funny.Billy M
How did you get in your wheelchair?Billy M
Oh my God, that's three times as long as it takes me.
Let me ask you something, how long does it take for you to do something simple, every day, like brush your teeth in the morning?Billy M
This, ladies and gentlemen, is our special guest.Billy M
Yes, right in here, come on in.Billy M
What you mean uh hmmm... ?
He grew into a man overnight.  Rare disability, still works.  A crossword puzzle Stanley, seriously, are you learning nothing here?
I don't think so, no.
Good question.  Forrest G
Ignore him.  You know what?  We're not that different, you and I.  When I clamped my foot into a non-stick... Billy M
Ok, I'll just have the pudding.
Did you get the yams?
You did it!  Look at you, and with the plate and the napkin.  Very nice.  Thank you, Ryan.
We'll go.  I'm still recovering. So let's just, Ryan, could you get my coat please.
Oh, ok, that's, great.  No, I can't drive.  Jim why don't you drive.
Why don't you go with him?
Oh, now you feel some compassion for him.
I know, just sayin'.
Chuck E. Cheese?  Oh, God, I'm so sick of Chuck E. Cheese.
Well, yeah she has one kid, no husband.  She's not gonna find one driving this thing around.
Stop spraying me!  Gimme the bottle!
Stop, stop it! Stop spraying!  Gimme the bottle!
Just give it! J
Gimme the bottle, Dwight!
Give me the bottle!!
Give it to me Dwight.
Dwight...   Give me the bottle or you're fired.
Give it to me.
No... you know what Jim, this isn't about me anymore.  I made a miraculous recovery, which is more than I can say for him.
Nothing.  I wrote "bringing someone to the hospital".
What do I write under "reason for visit"?
Something with a "K".
That's my joke, damnit Dwight.
Ok, what kinda machine is that?
Look since you have the machine up and running, can I just stick my foot, we take a look?
Well, you don't have all the information. The foot as been fairly severely burned and healed quickly, very quickly, actually like suspiciously quickly.
Uh, well you should of thought of before you crashed your head on your way to pick me up.  We'll, see you when you get out.
Alright, well, I guess this is where we leave you off.
Oh, oh, wow! I walked right into that. Oh, that's brilliant!
Ah, ah, ah, what? What? Where's the funny? Give it to me.
No, damn it!
I don't know, nothin', what's up with you?
Just forget it.
What does what mean?
Gotcha!  Crap! Nothin' how ya doing?
No, that's not... no, that's not what I was going to say.
On a Friday?
Yeah. Drop what you're doing. Make this a priority. Because an office can't function efficiently unless people are at their desks doing their jobs.
That's exactly what I was thinking.
He sounded sick.
I need you to go back to bed. I need you to get better. See you Monday.  Unless you're still sick.  So have a great long weekend.
What are your symptoms?
Really? Oh, that is a shame.  You know it's cleaning day here today? Could have used some of that famous Hispanic cleaning ethic.
Yechh, yeah, um, heard you were under the weather?
Hi, Oscar its Michael.
What difference does it make whether your here?
I will do all the talking.
Wowweee. Mikey likey. Why don't you wear your hair like that all the time.  It's much sexier.  Man, this must be torture for you.
Who else knows?
Can you hear me, they talk about us...
Peach iced tea. You're going to hate it.
Alright, well, cool.  Still deciding?
Listen Stanley. How long does it take you to pick out a soda?
No it's okay, we're talking code.
Any of em?  So, uh, what's the 411? Any news on the "P" situation?
Ah, good stuff, good stuff. Did you see the game last night?
I know just he place.
Hey you know what we could do? We could spread out a blanket in the break room.  Have a little picnic order some 'za. Talk about you know who.
Oh nonsense , no way, no. Why don't, why don't I take you out to lunch? My treat.
Whooo, nice. That was, that was slick.  What are you doin' for lunch?
Um, I don't know, yeah, yeah, yeah it is.
Not so much.
No, I'm gonna have the gourmet hot dog.
Mmmm, sounds yummy.  I will have a chicken breast hold the chicken.
Tell me Dana, how is your chicken breast?
I'm his boss actually.  And I treat him well. I'm taking him out to lunch cause I can afford it and he can have whatever he wants.
We're not worthy. We're not worthy. Hello Dana, I am Michael and this is Jim and we are brothers.
Thank you very much.
Ohhh happy birthday Jim!
Oh, thank you.
Her boobs, definitely.
Never get's any of my jokes.
Is it her boobs, or... J
Just do it.
Just go to his house and see if he's sick. I could have done this Investigation in like twenty minutes.
No he did not. I don't need his permission.
Yeah, it's a business lunch.
No. It's... I wear it like that sometimes. Is that a wig?
You're not his friend, you don't know. He is in love with a girl he works with who's engaged.  So just cut me some slack. Please?
Look Jim needed a relaxing lunch, he has been depressed and it has been affecting his productivity.  How is that not work related?
You know what Kevin? Jim is a friend of mine, so the only people that this crush really concerns is Jim and Pam... and me.
Yeah I'm good.
Ok, I'm fine, no I know, I'm good, I'm good, it's just.
I, oh, just, um, I know I was trying to, expense reports. And then God, Toby, you know he just... I know. I'm just, I just hope that, I just hope that  this doesn't affect our friendship! Stupid, this is so stupid.
I know, I know, I know.
Yehhh, okay, shuuttt it Michael. I'm done. That's it. I'm out.
It wasn't that long ago. It was on the booze cruise.
No, I feel it's my responsibility as your boss slash friend.
Yeah I'm fine. Look, about you and Jim.
Did you get lucky?  Oh!  Boink!
Check it out.
Um, somebody vomited right in the middle of the carpet in my office. K
Oh, God!  How could that happen?  How could... right in the middle of the carpet.
Is it a bird?
There is stink in there, my God!  What is... what is that?
Wow!  What happened in there?  P
How do you know that?  What is it, then? C
I cannot believe a pipe burst and left that in there.
That is worse. D
No, no, no!  Seriously, I don't mind sharing. J
Hey Jim.  I thought that we would be desk buddies while they changed my carpet.
I just... you couldn't understand, but man, you guys have it so easy out here, you know?  I used to sit right here.
The pressures of my office are insane.
This is great.
Don't ape me.
He was, but, uh... that desk was empty.  He'd come in and sit there sometimes.
Mm-mm.  Todd Packer. D
Oh, a customer, well, sound the alarm.  Okay.
Oh, okay.  Gah.
Old fashioned raid.  Sales on Accounting.  Yeah.  Follow my lead.
Let's send up Accounting.
Watch out, Pam. You're next!
No, no, no, no.  We don't do that.  We don't do that. D
Yeah! Oh ho ho
Ahem.  What's up? O
God, this is gonna be fun.
Oh, it is on, Phyllis, it is so on!
... I'm gonna leave it right over here where everybody can see it.  I will be taking Jim's clients today because he is not here and out of sight, out of the contest.  Let's see who winds up with the cash, shall we?  P
Extreme Home Makeover puts together a house in an hour.  If you were on that crew, you would be fired like that.
Yeah, paper business.  Is this done?  R
You know what, guys?  It's none of your concern.  It was official business, so just...
No.  Just ... D
Well I hated it!  A lot!  Okay, I... you know what?  If the guilty person would just come forward and take their punishment, we'd be done .   Very well.  Then you are all punished.  P
I am a victim of a hate crime.  Stanley knows what I'm talkin' about.
I wasn't talking literally, Creed.  Yeah, being buried alive would be worse. Happy?  Why am I talking to you?
My biggest fear is turning into him.
How would I know?
Well, okay.  Different management styles.
Well, that figures.  So how did you deal with people not liking you?
I didn't get a good look at... it, but it smells horrible.
Oh, no, no, no.  You're good.  It was clerical.  You're good.  Um, well, somebody did something in my office, and I now think that they did it on purpose and it was directed at me.
Uh, well, honestly Ed, I really don't wanna be up there right now.  E
That was Packer!  Oh, you're... you are dead.  You are dead, my friend!  That is hilar... Oh, God!  Of course it was you. P
Are you kidding me?  Oh!
Really?  Guys, did you see a big package in my office?
Did you see a big package?  Where did you leave it? P
Who is this?  How did you get this number? P
Anybody want any coffee or...
Well, I'm their boss, so I feel like... J
And they ended up turning the break room into a lactation room which is disgusting so... J
They did this up in Albany... J
No, just uh... you have come a long way, baby.  But I just... just want to keep it within reason.
Hold... Just hear me out. What is more important than Quality? E-Quality. Now studies show that today's woman, the Ally McBeal woman, as I call her, is at a crossroads... J
Yeah... I... You know what... I... I... I just thought about it. I just have a few things I want to say.
OK, OK, Fine. Yeah, actually, perfect. Perfect. You know what? There's another side to this place, gentleman. And I know we all love our cushy jobs and our fun, exciting office. But do you realize that underneath us, there's another world. The warehouse world. A world that is teeming with sweat and dirt and life. Life. The bowels of the office. These guys are down there, they are real men doing real man's work. We are going to learn how a warehouse works.
We have nowhere else Jan. This... D
Why can't boys play with dolls? Why does society force us to use urinals when sitting down is far more comfortable?
Just having a little 'guys in the workplace' thing.
That's what I'm talking about!
Roy and Pam. It's a Ram. It's a Ram thing.
Brangelina is the Brad Pitt and Angelina... Roy... R
You know, Darryl is actually the Foreman here and not Roy, which is cool. There's Roy riding the big rig. So Roy is actually going to be marrying Pam sometime this summer. And... uh, she's our receptionist. Sort of a Brangelina thing.
Oh... well... okay... yeah, you know what? I don't think... You.. You're... My job sucks compared to this. I don't think you'd like it up there.
We ought to have this thing serviced.
Oh, oh, oh!  We'll get somebody to clean that up.
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Hey, you're going to, going to hurt yourself.
No, why? Why would I... ? You could... M
OK. Alright. Good. Guys ragging on each other. That's what guys do... and we love it.
I hate shushing. You know, that's the thing! What the... ok... what is our beef as human men.
I was breathing.
I... That was just... D
OK, Yeah. Yeah. Yeah shhh...
The problem is the chicks. And you gotta blame them.
Yeah. You know what? I think the problem is the chicks.
You know what? Is that necessary? Because you already sorta have a union... of guys.
No. Whoa, whoa. Yeah.
It blows. It blows, man. Gah... D
I know. God! What is that?
I feel you.
I'm just saying we have something... Ok. Whatever.
We have a history... J
Ok. Come on Jan. After all we've been through... J
I mean I just don't want to have to tell them something they're not going to want to hear.
But we're bonding down there!
Don't talk to me that way please. Just... they're going to want to hear this from you.
I have essentially. Yes. I've taken some... J
Yuh, yuh, yes! I... I have essentially...
You did uh... okay.
Hey, watch it, watch it. We have a relationship.
All right. Deleted Scene 3
Working on it.
What are you guys talking about?Dwight and R
Yes. Deleted Scene 2
Dude, are you kidding me? No. That one says, "I am so lame." Know which one I want? There's one that sounds like a jackhammer. Just really grabs your attention. It's like...  You know what I'm talking about?
Which one of these is coolest? What do you think?
There's a lot of choices. You got to help me here.
And now, I realize that you can program or download any ring you want. So, I'm a little overwhelmed.
Oh! I don't know, Pam. I paid $400 for this phone because I liked the ring.
What is your problem?
I probably will, why do you ask?
Nope. The opposite of that. D
Cool. Good, good, good. Give us some time to catch up, and...
So what's going on? What I miss?
You have been kicked out of every strip club in Albany, is that true?
Maybe because she's my girlfriend.  Was, or not my girlfriend. She's... we hooked up and...
Ay, Kay. Come on, you know, that's not. Cool it.
This is Stanley Hudson, one of our talented salesman. An African-American father of two, Stanley's dedication is no doubt one of the hallmark's of the foundation of the business we're hoping to build our bases on.
Yes, thank you.
Yes. I'm sorry. I will fix this. I'll talk to him. I'll talk to David.
Technically, we fell asleep in the same bed. So...
No you're not.
I did, it was stupid. And Craig, you saw him, he's not the sharpest tool in the shed. Although he is a tool.
No no no no no, yes I, OK, well, alright, here's the deal. It's my fault. This is, this is totally on me. Before you guys came in, I was talking to the guys. We were all chatting and I made a joke, a really dumb joke and Craig the idiot took it seriously.
Yeah, Happy Valentine's Day.
Oh, no big deal. Really. Sorry again. J
You all right Ryan?
Give it to me. Phyllis, give me the ball. Ok, give me the ball. Give me, you guys... Creed give me the ball! Right now give it to me.
No! Yes, we have to! You know why? Because I don't like to be cooped up in that office! In that box! All day long.  Nice catch. Mmmm, mmm, mmm,mmm. Os-car! Intercepted. J
Have to think it through. Because if they say no...
Could go either way. We don't know what they are going to say.
Oh! Abso-fruit-ly. Fruit. Grapes. Nailed the joke. Matter of time. Um... And yes, it is a big speech. Biggest of your life.
Grapes. Seductive. So you ready for the big speech this afternoon?
Well, if you have a question, you should ask me.
But I can teach you enough so that you don't embarrass me or the company.
That's because you're incapable of doing it because you don't know how. Because you have no skills. Dwight, there's no way I can possibly teach you what you need to know about public speaking by speech time.
No, no! They would remember them. Look, it doesn't matter what you say. It just matters that you're saying something that people care about. Yeah? All right? Here we go. Watch this.
I do. Both of them.
Yeah, you're right about the difference between a man and a woman, but not about the punch line to the joke, right?  The difference between a salesman and a saleswoman... is boobs!
It's a joke, Dwight. It's not a Sex Ed class.
No, no! It's not true. I was just talking so just go out there and say anything. They'll eat it up. They're a great audience.
All right. Everybody in the conference room now. Let's go. Let's do it.
He's kidding. Dwight was kidding and I don't know why because it wasn't funny... and it was just horrible. S
Oh ho hokay. You know what? That's not a toast. You're not standing up.
Yes. Good. Jim taking the initiative.
Pam! I'm public speaking. Stop public interrupting me. Actually, this would be good practice for your wedding toast.
Well, it's mostly made up. So...
Gooood morning, Vietnaaaam! I am not Dwight Schrute. Not at all. I am Michael Scott, his mentor and boss. And until Dwight comes up, if he ever does, I wanted to say a few words about excellence. What makes a work environment excellent? Well, there are many things, I believe, that do such a thing of that nature. And one would be humor. What is the difference between a salesman and a saleswoman?
Dwight, they called your name.
Good luck. That is a tough crowd.
She might have been. So she says 'Fine. I will go to my room. I will get my purse. I will come back. I'll show you my ID.' She hasn't come back yet. She's probably in her room drinking from the mini-bar! Right?
Yeah, it was weird. So, she was like 'I don't have my ID, please give me one.' And he was like 'I can't do that. I can't serve you.'
Oh! This woman came in, sat down, ordered a drink. The bartender asked for her ID which I thought was odd because I pegged her at like 35.
You would not believe what happened here.
I got thirsty. How'd it go?
Yeah, well, you know what? We need to... All right, everybody in the conference room now. Let's go.
Iraq is sand. Sailors are on water.
Are you a 12-year-old girl? I don't know. There we go.
Pam. Ms. Beasley if yer nastay! Janet Jackson. Hey! You having a wardrobe malfunction there? Or w---
Okay, I'm Aquaman. Where does he live, guys?
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Hi, children. I'm Michael Scott, and... I... am in charge of this place... ahh, what'll make you... understand... I am... like Superman, and the people who work here are like citizens of Gotham City. Jim and D
Yeah, middle school's amazing. It is extraordinary. An extraordinary time.
All aboard for sales! Next stop, Cu...camonga!
Oh, you know what that is! That is a train whistle, like I'm the conductor.  You want to try?
Nice to meet you.
Alright. There goes Mister Poop. Now, who likes Dane Cook? The K
Don't! Don't! Don't talk about Nazis in front of--- you know what? They're going to have nightmares, so why don't you just shut it? D
What's a Nazi? D
Yeah, you know what? No, no no no no. They, no. The kids don't want to hear some wierdo book that your Nazi war criminal grandmother gave you. S
What the hell are you reading to them? D
No no no, we're not gonna see--- we're not gonna see the four toed... Creed, okay?
What are you doing? N--stop it! Stop it! Just--no, no, no, no! No! Would you cut it out?! What is your problem? C
...There's Creed! Let's take a look at what he's doing, everybody! This is Creed, and he is in charge of... something. Right?
Yes it is, well, w-w--you need someone in the middle to facilitate...
No, we don't actually cut the paper. That's a good question. The paper is sent to us cut, and dyed, from a paper manufacturer, and then we sell it to a business for more than we paid for it. A
Okay! Thank you Ryan. Good attitude, hottest in the office.
I want you to get the tambourine. Do you know how to play the tambourine? R
It's true! I can prove it! I can prove it, watch this.  I would like you to go to my mother's house in Dickson city, and if she is in the pool, the back kitchen window should be unlocked, I want you to boost yourself up, I want you to go down to the basement. In the basement is a tape labeled 'Fundle Bundle'. I want you to grab it, I want you to get my guitar. R
I am totally serious. There was a show called 'Fundle Bundle' and I was the star.
...I guess not... you know, I have a load of work to do so I am going to grab a slice of this delish pizza... and I'm going to go do my work. Bye.
Okay! Alright, okay.
Uh, just never happened.
Coulda sworn there was...
Oh! That's me. Shh. Shh. Edward R. M
Stop! Stop! Stop!  Yes! That is, uh, Edward R. Meow. J
That... is Miss Trudy. Can't tell from the costume, but she had an amazing body. Okay, you can... fast forward. And... I want you... to... D
Thank you. T
Oh, that's okay, she can keep those. T
Thanks, that's, no, that... that really means a lot to me. Hey, does Sasha have a godfather, because I...
...Jan. Kay. T
Tell me something honestly, do you... think... that it is too late for me to have kids?
One more time.  You...
Hey, uh, no, please? You can't leave yet. There's still one more thing we need to do. M
You know what, Toby? When the son of the deposed king of Nigeria emails you directly, asking for help, you help! His father ran the freaking country, okay? ...Alright, so, raise your hand if you wanna get rich.  Alright.
Yes! Thank you! You will get rich quick. We all will!
You know what? That's a nice attitude, Ryan, I'm just helping you invest in your future, my friend. O
Don't worry about Phil. He drives a corvette. He is doing just fine. Okay. Calling cards are... the wave of the future. These things sell themselves. R
Thank you! That's really nice.
Oh ho ho! What?
Ah, thank you sir.
Let's get the party started.  Not the way I taught you!
Don't! Nope! Please, don't want to spoil it for anybody. Spoil the surprise.
Not necessary, the party planning committee is all over it.  They've been working twenty-four seven all day yesterday.
Thank you very much. It is from Italy.  Actually--- no, Bulgaria.
No no no, no, new suit, please. D
...You can take a five, if you want.
Nope. Totally private. You can say whatever is in your heart.
Really? 'Cause, I thought we had the same birthday.
Well, I guess I forgot to give you a donut .
You didn't know it was my birthday.
Somebody got donuts for my birthday!
Here we go. Ohhhkay, this is great!  Okay, um, alright. This has arms. Is that gonna be a... is that alright? Delivery W
You're making it worse. I bet Luke Perry's friends don't treat him like this .
Yeah, well, it's on the radio. My birthday blows. Nobody even signed my birthday poster. Probably my mother is the only one that cares enough to send me anything.
Whoa whoa! Alright. Alright. Watch it... please. D
Ohh, no, no, no! I can't... Ryan, come on. Let's do this.
Ohhh, no. D
Just the bread, it's fresh baked.
Birthday party subs! My gift to you. O
Get in here... everybody. D
... Aww, that... sucks, great. ... Wow, that's good timing. That's... that's, sorry, that's terrible. Terrible news. That's terrible... terrible news for both of us .
Okay. Well, when she comes back we'll do it again.  Hello, what about the birthday boy? Haven't had a hug all day. A
... I asked for trick candles.
Uhhh... blow out the candle. Okay. Mmmm...
Are you done? ...Good. Okay.
Kevin? Respect the birthday please.
Well, you're pretty much driving everyone else here crazy... crazy with worry.
Why are you here? I didn't even invite you to my birthday party.
And laughter... also.
Yeah, but it's not brain cancer. And it shouldn't stop us from having fun. You know what they say the best medicine is.
There you are. Good news. Did some research. It turns out that 98% of people with skin cancer fully recover.
Excuse me, everyone. Attention please. Kevin, we're going to take you to a very special place, a place that will make you happy, and a place that is far, far away from the evil sun. S
No, it's alright. It's already up. Just leave it. Where's Kevin? Come on! Let's get our skate on!
Hey Pam, all this stuff with Kevin... um, it's pretty scary. And I'm thinking that uh, next time you're in the shower, you should check yourself out. You know, give yourself an exam. Those things are like ticking time bags. Alright? Think about it.
Cool. Alright. Grab on. Here we go. Ready? Hang on tight. Alright. We are moving. We are reaaallly mooovin' now!
Oh, hey guys. Whats up? You wanna go for a ride? Is that okay? C
Oh, these... all your kids? C
Yeah. Carol? She sold me my condo! Hey! What, is this place on the market? Or...
Okay. Well. Live strong.
Kevin. You heard anything yet?
Oh... God... .
Thank you... Dwight. That's great. Thanks.
Cool. Ohh. Great. From Dwight.
Okay, who's this from? Wowwwee, look at that! Jersey!
Why don't you just cool it, cool it Dwight, please, God!  I totally lost it, 'cause I was half-baked. Smokin' doobies. Doobie brothers, I was smokin' doobies with my brothers. Peace out, Seacrest! J
Hmmm. Ha.  Alright. Great.
No, uh, no. That was a test.  I was testing you, and you all failed. Miserably. When I said that Dwight was a narc, how many of you defended him?  How many of you said, "Hey, you know what, he's right? What he's doing is protecting this office from the evils of drugs." D
No. Oh. Uh...
That is... who makes that?
So what, you're having a little spat. I forget, are you guys dating?
What's the problem?
Yeah, well... that's not gonna fly here. Because in this office, it is till death do us part... assuming we don't get downsized.  Uh, Pam, will you get Angela and meet us in the conference room please?
What do you know about conflict resolution? Your answer to everything is to get divorced. So... T
Win/Win is number four and number five is win/win/win. The important difference here is with win/win/win, we all win. Me too. I win for having successfully mediated a conflict at work.
Just hold on, please! Okay, if we do lose/lose, neither of you gets what you want. Do you understand? You... you would both lose. Now I need to ask you, do you want to pursue a lose/lose negotiation?
No. Okay, this is important. The first style is lose/lose.
Okay, that is called a compromise. And it is style 3. And it is not ideal. To sum up, win/win - make the poster into a t-shirt, win/lose - take the poster down, compromise - Tuesdays and Thursdays. And the answer is... make the poster into a t-shirt! Win/win.
Yes. Thank you, Pam. How about Angela makes the poster into a t-shirt, which Oscar wears. That way, he can never see it and whenever she looks at Oscar, she can see it. Win/win/win.  O
Come on, seriously, that?
Okay.  All right... is that it?
You can't do that, huh? Huh, ok. Now you and I have a conflict. I order you to give me that file.
I would like to see those please.
Are those all the other complains?
You will notice that not one of these complaints is against me.
Uh...  Who else? Why don't we just warm up first? Warm up emotionally, all right?
All right, Pamela. Come on down! Let's do it! And ... okay. Just one complaint. Actually, it has been withdrawn. So that is no help to us. Next.
Oh, ok. There were a bunch of complaints about Dwight that were put in the redacted file about six months ago.
That's what she said.  The thing is, Angela... you are in here an awful lot. You have complained about everybody in the office, except Dwight, which is odd because everyone else has had run ins with Dwight. Toby, by the way, what does "redacted" mean? There is a file full of complaints in here marked "redacted"... ?
You got a lot of anger under there buddy. Come on start us out. Unleash it.
And... also, Phyllis, Stanley says that you cry too much, and that bugs him.
Okay, Phyllis. You complained that Angela's giving you dirty looks. And you tried to get off the party planning committee.
Okay! Calm down.
You know your I.D. says you're a security threat?
Okay... you two, in the conference room with me. Nobody leaves until we work this out. Cage match!
Maybe, I haven't decided yet. Let's get to work.
Come on, everybody.
Ugh... All right. Everybody,  come on. Group photo for the newsletter.    S
It'll take like two seconds.
Well... that's... what, a computer camera, right?
Okay, good. Check that out.
You just press the button.
Good, let's check that out.  Ew, okay, all right. One more. We'll take one more.
We resolved a lot today, everybody. Think happy thoughts.
You know, it'd be fun. I can hear it in your voice. You need a break.
I am, but you are the Eva Peron to my Cesar Chavez.
Emeril. Oh, actually, while I have you, not that I have you or have ever had you, but we're having our Casino Night tonight and I think everyone would love to see their fearless leader here. J
Jan, listen, I promise that I will kick it up a notch. Bam!
Top 80 percent!
Well, then, they need our money more than ever. A
So get your charities in to Pam. I, for example, am playing for Comic Relief.
Well, Oscar, if you don't like it, then you should concentrate on winning. Because the person at the end of the evening with the highest chip count will receive $500 to donate to the charity of their choice. And they will get a mini-fridge compliments of Vance Refrigeration.
Well, they need our money. They don't have cookies like the Girl Scouts.
Okay, you know what? No. No. AIDS is not funny. Believe me, I have tried.
No. Humans with AIDS.
Why are you the way that you are? Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not... that way. I hate so much about the things that you choose to be. Okay, you know what? I will not donate my winnings to Comic Relief, since apparently it doesn't exist. I am going to donate to Afghanistanis with AIDS. J
Dinkin' flicka. D
That you are afraid. D
Oh, yeah, put her through. Hey Carol, how goes the real estate biz? Is it real good?
Do I know a Carol Stills?
Two queens on Casino Night. I am going to drop a deuce on everybody.
Good, All right. Sounds great.
Bye Hello, Carol? Hi, sorry about that. I just...
Okay, sounds great.
Hey, Jan. How you doing?
Okay, put her through.  Jan Levinson, I presume?
Oh, I'm sorry. Could you hold on? Yes?
Yeah. It'll be fun. What do you... What do you...
Yeah, it'll be good. You know what? Why don't you come by? Bring the papers, I'll sign them and then you can stay and have a drink.
Actually, I'm sort of hosting this charity thing in our warehouse, Casino Night.
Great. It has a little bit of a weird smell. It's okay. At Christmas, the tree helped. C
Oh, hey, no problemo. Incidentally, I love the place.
Hi, Carol. How you doing?
Oh, well... Kiss.
You look great.
Chili's is great.
Your nurse became your girlfriend? Sweet.
Billy, your nurse is hot.
Shut it, shut it, shut it. Will Lady Fortune be your mistress? Only time will tell, my friends. Leave all your preconceived notions about casinos at the door. Old friends, new lovers, and the disabled!  Welcome all! Great, okay. Shuffle up and deal. Let's get it started! Black-Eyed Crows.
You really screwed that up.
Okay, all right, whatever.
Well, Toby, I went all-in on the first hand, so doesn't that tell you that I might have good cards, too? So don't be stupid. Just take it back.
What are... That's insane.
After you said you weren't coming, I invited Carol to come and I don't think that I did anything wrong.
Look, okay, I think we're all adults here, and it has always been my understanding that we have an open relationship.
Yeah, whatever. Hey, you know what? If luck weren't involved, I would always be winning.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
So close. So close.
Four!  All right, here we go!
Oh, she's great.
Good night. She's a good boss.
Okay. Talk to you Monday.
Okay. Thanks for coming.
"One of them was named Michael Scott, and he was an..." Oh, damn it. Okay. Okay, okay, we're... Okay, we're starting over.
Good. Thank you, Phyllis. That wasn't so hard. All right, here we go. "Office Depot is an annoying store. One day Creed went there to buy paper. And he ran into irritating Cylons."
No, Toby, damn it, come on! We already have that. I need something fun. Something like fat or smelly. Or pukey. Pukey. Pukey's good. Okay. Pukey. Now I need a noun.
We already have that. So...
No, no, no. No, no, not until you give me an adjective.
Okay, all right.
Where the hell is that?
That's what faggie means!
OK, a little too far, crossed the line.
Yeah, I know.
It wasn't just an action movie, it was Die Hard!
No.  No it's not.  I feel terrible about it.  I have been calling people "faggie" since I was in junior high, and I have never made this mistake.  If I don't know how to behave, it is because I am just so far the opposite way, you know?  I'm just... I, I can't even imagine... the... thing.  Maybe we could go out for a beer sometime.  And you could tell me... how... you do that to another dude.
Yeah, I'm sure everyone would appreciate me treating them like they were gay.
There could be others...  I need to know.  I don't want to offend anybody else.  D
Well, he is.
What about Oscar?
I don't know, I can imagine her with another woman, can't you?
Let's call him and get the website.
That's ridiculous.  D
Well, I'm not gay Jan, and you should know that better than anybody!
I don't kn--
I think Angela might be gay.  Could Oscar and Angela be having a gay affair?  Maybe!  Is that what this is about?
Well, gay pride, right? Gay pride parade?  It's not like gay... shame festival.
What?  What does that even...
I watch the L Word.  I watch, Queer as F***, so...
Trick question!  Cause you can't always tell, so... how would I know.  Is that the right answer?
Yes, that's a good point.  She has a good point.  Because gay marriage currently is not legal, under U.S. law.  I bet a lot of straight men wish that applied to them.  So they could go out there and have some torrid unabashed monkey sex as much as they could.  You know?  Sounds pretty good, right?
That's great.  Congratulations Phyllis.  That is great, and frankly kiiiiiiiind of amazing!   See?  Everybody has a chance!
No no no.  The only signal that I am sending i
No, I am just coming out myself.  I am coming out hetero!
Well, I just like to look good OK, so ---
...and I just don't care who sees it, doesn't bother me!
You misunderstand-- OK.  You know what, OK.  I uh, I'm gonna put my money where my mouth is.  You ready?  I am going to embrace Oscar.  You might want to watch this Angela, because you can't catch anything.  Here we go.  We are going to make a statement.  You and I are going to make a statement together.  Oscar is my friend ---
I'm sorry I called you faggie.  You're not faggie.  You're a a good guy.
All right, um... sorry.
Oh come on!  Dwight!  Come on, man!
Specifically, Jan, I will make at least ten phone calls to clients.
I will do my regional manager job to the best of my capability.
I will do my job to the best of my abilities.
Aw. Well, hang in there, okay?  You know what? You should get one of this big body pillows. That way you wouldn't miss you-know-who so much.
Oh, good. By yourself?
It's a deal.
You know what, Pam? If in ten years, I haven't had a baby, and you haven't had a baby... P
I don't even know if I'll want a baby in eight months.
Um... find out if there's a cheaper, less expensive baby out there, okay?
Just do it, okay?
Angelina Jolie was on. And she adopted a baby from Asia, and she said that it changed her life. And that really inspired me. So, I want you to look into seeing how much a little Chinese baby would cost.
I, uh... I am going to be a father.
Did you see Oprah yesterday?
Right there. Ah.
Um.Dwight and M
Write it down.
You got that?
Really? Okay. Well, word of a
Yeah, do it!
Oh, wow! Oh my God, I have a great idea. You know what you should do to be hilarious? Wear your wedding dress. It would be a great icebreaker.
Sleep with who? Whom, whom... whom?
Good to see you. There he is! There's the traitor! Traitor! Traitor! Come here, you. Come here! Yeah! The product... the progidal... my son returns.
Hey, Josh, how ya doing?
Yeah! Wow, I didn't expect that. It's good to see you too!
Thank you for being so brave with all of this. Thank you.
The eight-hundred pound gorilla in the room. Carol. I'm still dating her, so nothing can happen between us at the convention.
Jan? Look, I think we need to set some ground rules.
Ugh, that would be gross. It's not even lunch yet.
All right, see you guys down there. Change your mind, come back up.
Wish I was. I love inside jokes. I'd love to be a part of one someday.
Hey, well, we have time! One for the road, gentlemen?
Well, that's how we do it in Scranton. Or did you forget? There ain't no party like a Scranton party, 'cause a Scranton party don't stop.
That is crooked on that side.
I know! That is specifically why I chose a room close to the elevator. More foot traffic.
Because he's afraid to fly.
So maybe. See ya.
Well, cool! Okay, so... can I tell people you're gonna be there?Jerome B
You know what? I'm having a huge blowout tonight, Room 308. Hope you can come.Jerome B
Do you remember me from last year? There's a party in my room, 308, can't miss it, right off the elevator. Tonight. Be there!
May I have a moment of your time please?
I don't have to, I just know. Yes, hello?
Yep. Yeah, she's up front.
I want you to dig up some dirt on Josh. Find out if there are any skeletons in his attic.
Toby Flenderson is everything that is wrong with the paper industry. Is he why you left?
I will call him later with that message.
Yeah. Moved Ryan over to your desk.
The party I'm having tonight in 308. Obviously, you are invited.
I have generated a lot of interest in my party this evening.
No, that was a different hundred dollar bill.
Hey, Jan, Jan? Don't worry, I have got the tip.
Any messages for 308? All right.
Yes. That is Josh and Dwight and Jim.  Have fun on your date! Very good, talk to you later. Bye.
Shut it.  Say hi to Pam! Jim, Josh, and D
Okay! Excellent. Oh... D
Oh, Jim. Looks like you picked a bad time to defect, my friend.
Hey, check this out. How about that? A little friendly competition. Stamford versus Scranton.
Well, let's... J
Not. It hit the rim. Okay, and... okay. Double or nothing.
Okay, let me tell you what we're looking for.
Yeah, well, maybe next time you will estimate me.
Used to be. Evan will call you in the morning to work out the details. We can now sell HammerMill products.
Yes, Jan, really. With a rep from HammerMill.
Party central! So, what can I do you for?  All right.
This is the party.
Hey, Ernie, how ya doing?
Evan, this is Jim.
Hey! No, you know, people have been filtering in and out.
I will. I'll talk to her. You should at least talk to Roy. I mean, he knows exactly how you're feeling.
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry. Hey, you know what? I will talk to her.
Oh my God. You don't even know. She's single now.
I'm not better than Josh.
I get it! No, no, I totally get it. He made a better paper airplane, Stamford is better in sales... I get it. We had some fun. We had some laughs. And that's just... J
Sure, sounds good. So why are you here? Is Josh busy?
Sure. You like Cosmos?
People have been filtering in and out.
Oh, God, I hope it's urine.
Whoa. What are those stains?
Gonna be fun! Change your mind we can get you a cot.
Sure you don't want to come?
Yes. What? Oh, yeah, have Pam give those to me.
Per-diem.  You know, Ryan, it's all about the Benjamins.
I know, I know. Crazy world. Crazy, crazy world.
I was going to be a bottle capper.
Yup. Yeah, I applied for a job there.
I almost worked there.
Yes pleeeeease!  Thank yooouuu!
Alright, everybody here?  Yes.
Don't whine.  Get the window.
No... they have to... to make up for the time they lost watching the movie.
People work faster after...
Three hours, wow.  Have fun.
...you were at the dentist?
Oh.  That's nice.
Huh.  Sounds a lot like dentist.
Your dentist's name is Crentist.
What's his name?
Sounds like a good dentist.
Hey.  I thought you weren't supposed to eat anything for a couple hours after you've had a crown put in.
They're good, huh?
No seriously.  You should have an M&M, they're really good.  D
Do you want an M&M?
Well then... I am glad you're ok.
You should... floss.
Can't you?  That's so nice.
All right.  Well then, you are now acting manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton Branch, and I... am assistant regional manager.
Perfect, well, we're settled.
Yep, I did.  I did.  But I think... you should do it. D
I know.  I told her I didn't know whether you'd wanna do it... because you've always been so loyal to me.  You've been my most trusted ally.
And she said that you should be expecting a call later from corporate, and that um, I guess that means that you are going to be acting manager of Dunder Mifflin, Scranton.
Yeah. You know what the craziest part of this is? She demoted me to your job!  D
Well, I just got off the phone with Jan.  And um... she demoted me.
Because that's all it takes.
You might think that I am kidding, and I understand that.
I... won't.   I won't.
No, no, I don't, but---
Oh, I'll be fine.
THAT'S MY CAR.
That's my car.
Take it back.
But you said you liked it.  You've always admired it.
It's a corporate lease Dwight, you've earned it.  D
You can get up.  Get up.
I don't know if I can trust you anymore.
I have a laundry machine!
Not.  Good.  Enough!
Give me one good reason why I should fire you RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT?!
Oh do you?  Do you like the Sebring--- HOW DARE YOU?!  How dare you, Dwight?
I know, what you did.  I made the whole thing up, Dwight.
Jan called me about your little meeting!
I'm not firing anyone.
What do you know about management, Dwight?
It is not your business, Dwight.
Okay, well, we had scheduled this time to watch a movie together, so I guess I will just go play some online Scrabble.
There's coffee in the kitchen, Pam.
There you go, fresh from the warehouse.
Don't mind if I do.  See you in a minute.
There you go.
Oh, it's okay, I'm going down.
That's right, you worked with him.  So did Creed.  Well, I'll be in my office in case anybody wants to drop by.  Cheer me up.
Yes, I am.  It's very sad.  Because he was my boss.
Oh, gosh, what can anybody do, really?  It's... pssssh... .  He was almost 70.  Circle of life.  P
Oh my God.
The older you get, the bigger the chance is you're gonna die.  You knew that.
Yeah.  Must really have you thinkin'.
I didn't... he was driving on the road and he went under a truck.  And that's when his head was separated from the rest of him.  And I will let you know more as soon as I find out.
What are you doing?
But Ed truck can't because he is---  J
Well, we are talking about how to properly honor a man who gave his life as regional manager of this company, Jan.
I think that is a great way to honor Ed.
We could have his eyes light up, we could have his arms move... D
Well, I think it would be very realistic, it would look just like him. J
A statue.  J
You really don't get it, do you?  You don't understand these people.  That is the last thing that they would want is a day off. J
Well, you know what?  There's something wrong with you.  There is something wrong with everybody in here.  Because we have lost a member of our family and you don't wanna talk about it, you don't wanna think about it, you just wanna get back to work!
Well, you know what?  I didn't wanna hear about it either, Stanley, but I did and now I can't stop picturing it.  He leaves work, he's on his way home... wham!  His cappa is detated from his head!
That that bird was dead?  Did you check its breathing?  T
How do you know?
Yeah.  Well, you know what?  The guy who had my job has died.  And nobody cares!  And he sat at my desk.
You are not leaving.  No!  We are not done.
Do you want to talk about it anymore?
Okay... I'm going to toss the ball to Pam.
Oh, yes Stanley.  Come on.  Your turn, you have to go.
Yeah.  Pam, you're a member of this family.  So we will wait for our family members. Phyllis, you wanna give it a shot?
We don't know if it's dead.
Well, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, Meredith.  But that is what you do when things die.  You honor them.  Toby killed this bird.  And now we are going to honor it.  A
It's okay.  It's okay.  Shh... yes, I know, I know. It's been a tough day, but it's good to let it show.
No, God, no it's not!  What is the matter with you?  Is that the beak!?
What are... What are you doing?
Dwight, do you have the box?
...'Cause I'm the first to to find out. Nobody else knows and it is my responsibility to tell them. Well, good. How are you holding up? Want me to come over?
Okay, yes, sure, I will do that...
But I'm the first in the office?
Does his family know?
Oh, wow. He...
Well, then I guess that makes you about the worst grief counselor in the world, doesn't it?
No, that can't be right.
You are disgusting.
You think that's funny.
No, you said something, didn't you?
What was that, Kevin?
You're ruining it, already. They should not be given the choice.
No. No. Shh. Enough. It is going to take me hours to undo all the damage that your have done here. Dwight, Ryan, I want you to take the table out. We're gonna go on a five minute break, and when you come back, we're going to start with a clean slate, and, in the interim, I would like you to forget everything that Toby has said, okay?
Wow. Wow. No. No. You are the most heartless, soulless person I've ever met.
Nothing. Let's just... all right.  Guys, do you have a box we could use?
Okay, give it to me. You don't know what you're doing. All right.
Wow. Well. Ok. I don't care how your day was either, Jan. I was just asking you because you asked me. Why do you set me up like that?
Yeah, nothing. How was your day?
Uhhh... nothing. J
Boooooo. Thank you. . That's right. B
No, I'm not going to settle down.
No, I think you're cutting in line.
Hey, hey, hey! Phyllis, what are you doing?
Because I like them a certain way, and if it gets screwed up, then whole thing is blown. P
I thought that maybe you could wait in line for me while I go to the bathroom. You're an angel.
No cuts. Oh, Pam. Just the woman I'd like to see. You read my mind. P
Thank God. Pretzel g
Hi. Please tell me that you have a sweet pretzel left.Pretzel g
Mr. Kosseli. Hey hey hey, the Cos. What's going on? Do we have a deal? Deal or no deal? Let's make a deal. So what is the deal?
Carmel Dip. But, one question at a time please. Phyllis, Stanley. I want you to switch desks, I'm going to reorganize and restructure the physical layout of the office to maximize everything! I think we're getting a lot done, don't you? On paper at least. And we are, after all, a paper company. Are we not, are we not, are we not? Are you with me, are you with me? Thank you very much!
And I will be taking questions. P
Yes, second, Toby. Second, I am insisting on increased accountability from every single one of you. K
Yes. Right. Good. P
Oh. Koselli. With the Jello. P
AM or PM?
A woman spurned.
Yes, big if.
Do you want me to go on Amazon and order you a slang dictionary? Cause I'll do it.
Well, that's really not the way I roll, because sometimes I'm in the zone, and sometimes I'm in the zoning out.
Would you look at that?  Damn it, Dwight! Come on.
If you lay a finger...
I always do.
Okay. That sounds good.  Yes. Actually, today's a good day to do that.
I mean, they're just dough twisted up with some candy. They taste so good in my mouth.
Nice dress, Ryan.
How come you didn't get me one?
Hey. Hey. Stop that. That is offensive. Indians do not eat monkey brains. And if they do... sign me up... because I am sure that they are very tasty and nutritional.
Wha? Really? You should! It's fun.
Just stop it.  Where did that come from?
No. This is delightful, charming culture.
No, You're not going to collect them.
Thank you, Kevin.
Hey, Kevin. It's a costume. Why don't you just cool it, okay? Carol? Carol.
No one's even going to notice.
What does that look like to you?
Do you think they have any s'mores?
No. These s'mores are disgusting.
She is. Very fair and very kind. So... um... tell me, is your marriage the kind of thing where when you die she has to throw herself on a fire? No? Okay. It's still very cool. Ok. Thanks!
Oh! She's not a cheerleader. She thought this was a costume party! Um... no, we're not married... yet!Kelly's M
Oh, you've got to be kidding me. Okay.
I didn't hear you.
I'm going to be.  Um... everyone? I'm sorry, could I have your attention, please. Thank you. Ah-hah... Hi. Sorry. I just have an announcement to make. Um... okay. I have learned a lot about Indian culture tonight. But I have learned even more about love. And I know you're all thinking 'who is this crazy gringo and what is he talking about?' Well, I'm not crazy. Maybe I'm crazy in love. So without further ado, Carol? Carol Stills. I would like you to do me the honor of making me your husband. C
All right. Good night.
Ok. Okay. Good night.  Hey, you know what? Why don't I come with you. Cause I've got this book called the Kama Sutra.
Yeah, well, but I ... I feel like I've known you many lifetimes. Maybe I'm Hindu after all. Okay, I'm not Hindu, but... Carol. Carol, I just... I feel like... I just like you so much.
Can I have a ride home?
What are you doing?
We're so alike. So alike.
Yeah. Uuuuh... well.
I was in that marriage arena, though.
Wow. Pam. When Carol said 'No.' tonight, I think I finally realized how you must be feeling. We are both the victims of broken engagements.
Oh. You waiting for a call?
That's so spicy.
Yeah, you should see her naked.
For Kelly, that seems a bit much.
Oh, I dunno about that.
... customer service is a Hindu person.
I bet you're not even aware that our own Kelly Kapoor, who works in...
---rolled into one.
You don't know what Diwali is? Wow, Jan. I'm surprised. It's the Hindu festival of lights. I just assumed you'd be familiar with it. It's the most sacred and honored Hindu holiday in the world. It's like Christmas, Easter, and Halloween---
What is Diwali?
Well, I was letting everybody go to the big Diwali party.
An Indian Halloween. Okay, great.  Pam, could you put Jan on, please?
Oh, please, stop talking. Three words or less.
So, any questions?
Oh really, what role is that? King of the stupid universe?
Oh, you gotta be... Josh?
Oh...  Oh, my god. Oh, my god! I don't really get it 'cause we're not doing that bad and our numbers are gonna come up.
Am I a small number person or a severance package person?
On whom's authority?
I don't understand.
Just call me Levinson in the morning, baby.
...thing in the morning. Love to start my morning with a hearty bowl of Jan.
Well... we have nothin to talk about, Dwight. Just do your work ... while you still can.
Don't say that. That just sounds weird. Please.
Do I have any messages?
Nothing, Pam. What difference does it make?  We'll be gone in a couple of weeks anyway.
Nothing. Just checking in. I can't tell you, so...
Yeah, great! Amazing. Best physical condition of my life.
I don't know. Probably not. This is the worst.
Traitor. You are a traitor.
You knew about this all along, didn't you?
So, you'll be okay too. You're a warrior. You're smart, capable. You'll find something else and...
I know, I know. Well, I'll land on my feet. Don't worry about me.
Darryl. Noble Darryl.
Yes. This might get ugly. I need backup.
No. There's no one else.
Go to New York, confront the CFO, show him he's making a mistake... save the branch.
You sent him cards? You never met him.
Okay, okay. Um...
Excuse me, Mr. Wallace?
Don't touch me this time.
Because he'd be intimidated and I, just... let's start again. Just be more scared of me, okay?
Stop... stop it! Just, okay. He's not going to say any of that.
Yes, but these are employees, Sir. These are human beings.
I will improvise. I will speak from the heart.
No, not until I have some good news for them. Not until I have some good news.
Oh, hmm, all of them. I loved them all. Every single one. D
Oh, right. Okay, that's enough. That's good.
That was hilarious. The foam ...
All right, favorite moments in Dunder-Mifflin history. Go.
What if this doesn't work? What is the office actually goes under?
I don't understand.
How did we do it?
We did it!
Right here! Right here! Michael and D
We did it? We did it.
Oh, this was such a stupid idea! This was so stupid. I am such a stupid idiot. I let everybody down. Everybody hates me. I lost everybody's jobs. Nobody likes me anymore!
Karen Filip...  Ka-ren Fili-pell-li.
I'm not firing somebody on the first day.
Got the food? Good! Looky-looky-looky. What I want you to do... set it up in the conference room, please. Make it look nice. As if you are trying to impress a much older man who's way out of your league.
Welcome to our humble abode. Follow me to your desk. Your ball and chain is right over here.
Ah! Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding. Our first arrival. Welcome to Scranton. This is Hannah Smoterich-Barr.
Mmm... dah. I am actually your boss, Michael Scott. Welcome. Wow! You are very exotic looking. Was your dad a G.I. or uh?
Welcome, welcome, welcome!  Take me to your leader. Oh wait, I am your leader.
Wh..and coupons... to various hot spots around Scranton.  All right! Let me show you to your area, sir. Come on, big guy.
Well, they're just for guests. If there are any left over, you can buy one later.
Gardner! I knew that. There you go. Gift bag... for you.  Okay.
They are nifty! They're nifty gifties.
A-ha-ha-ho. Very good! Welcome to our little kingdom. Ah, we have a bag of nifty gifties for you.
Ah! You must be Andy Bernard. Aloha and welcome!
Free of charge. Follow me, I will show you where all the slaves work.  Not... so, your desk is... J
How are you? Martin Nash, I presume? This is a little gift bag for you.
No way. Get him out of here. We don't want any of this kind in here. Good to see you, man.
I don't care! Dwight! You all report to me! That's all that matters! The rest of it just work out amongst yourselves, ok?
Let's face it. Moving to a new job can be very stressful. So I have made an orientation video especially for you newcomers. But it's not like any orientation video that any of you have ever seen. It's funny. It's got a little bit of a zing to it and I hope that it gives you a flavor of what we're all about here at Dunder Mifflin. And what we're all about here in Scranton. So let's just all laugh together and watch "Lazy Scranton".
No, it's not beef... just... sit down, please.  Welcome. Help yourself.
Well, then... consider it poisoned beef. No touchy.
Nope. Um... for the guests it is. For you, consider it cow-meat. Strictly taboo. K
Nope, no. Guests only.
The Electric City. Call poison control if you're bit by a spider.
The Electric City. Scranton.
They call it Scranton.
So check out how we live Michael & D
Sittin' in my office with a plate of grilled bacon, call my man Dwight just to see what was shakin'.
You like coal mines and you wanna see 'em, Well, check it out, yo, the Anthracite Museum! Plenty of space in the parking lot,
Well, so far, I think it is killin'. I thought it would either be an 'A' or an 'A+' but I completely forgot that there's an 'A++'.
How did you... C
What is that? A squid's eye or... H
All right, all right, I'm on a roll.
Okay, I told you these guys had a sense of humor.
You me? You me? Me you me! You! You! You me you! You! Oh my nose so itchy, why's my nose so itchy!
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Okay, here we go.Andy & M
Yes, yes! Okay!
Ssshh stupid! Um... A
Well, we'll squeeze you in.
I don't understand.
Whoa Whoa Whoa! Okay.
You've got it, you've got it.
You've got it.
Up and over. T
I'm right in your crack!
We've almost got it. Push it! Push it!
Bend at the knees. Okay, here we go. Here we go. I'm under this... I'm under this hock here. I don't know what I'm grabbing here.
Come on. We're doing this thing! Let's get up.
Don't be shy! Dwight! Let's do this!
You know what? I'll help. I will... T
Not today. No. Tony! Please join your cohorts on the table if you would. T
Don't try to apologize to me, man! It's too late. Just get out! Take your bad vibes with you.
You are fired! I'm sorry, but we don't have quitters on this team! Just clean out your desk!
Okay. Well, don't bother quitting because you're fired.
No. We do have to get along. Can't we all just get along? Or have we forgotten the words of the Reverend King.
Yeah! They punk'd us! They punk'd us good! Come on. Come on!
THIS IS EGREGIOUS! This is egregious!
No. No, no, no. No.  You are falling for it. You're playing right into their hands. This is just what they want you to do. Don't, oh... M
Why? I will tell you why. Because they saved the worst for me. They put a hate note under my windshield wiper. Check this out. It's so hateful.  "You guys SUCK! You can never pull together as one and revenge us. That is why you SUCK!"
Go home, Toby. Just... M
But do you realize that that was actually Dwight's idea? Bad advice from my Number Two.
I did. Major personnel crises averted. Compliment accepted.
All right, just...
Oh, nicknames, yay! Penguin power. A
Good, what's funny?
So I think in order for us all to work together well we must come together as a family and then we can all be  a king of hearts.
All right. Good. Thank you. . So to be a great salesman is to be a king of hearts. Turn over your card.
Beautiful. Very good, nice.
You're a jerk. Dwight's a jerk!
Idiot. Dwight's an idiot! Did you catch that or did... did the cough cover it?
We heard what you said. You didn't cover it at all.
We heard it. J
Look at all those staplers! What's a stapler!? I don't even know, I'm a baby! Hey, Mom, I'm thirsty! I'm thirsty, Mama! I want some milk. And you know where milk comes from! Breasts.
Ohh. May I?
Because you think he's black.
I didn't hire an ex-convict. Unless they mean Toby. Convicted rapist.  ... I'm just kidding.
Good. All right.
Sssssso, what we need to do... is to forget about this whole Martin in prison thing. People will draw unfair conclusions about Martin and or black people.
Okay, are you cool, really?
Oh. Please. Colin Powell. K
...Danny Glover.  Yeah.
Ah. Good good. Good. Just a second. Everybody? May I have your attention please? I realize that a lot of you have already heard that Martin here has had some trouble with the law, but I just want to declare publicly that I... trust... him, completely, and that anybody who doesn't is an ignorant, dumb... person. Okay? As a matter of fact, you show me a white man you trust and I will show you a black man that I trust even more. Pam. Tell me a white person you trust.
No. That's not cool. You don't have to tell them. M
No you would not.
Well, we are running a business, so.
Yeah, it's... freaking cold out here. Anybody wants to stay out, you've got about... twenty-seven minutes of rec time.
It's uh... two and a half. I'm not going for bulk, I'm going for tone. S
No, not Harry Potter. ... There are no movies in prison. This is my point! You guys got it soft, and cushy! This place is freaking awesome! The people are awesome! Your boss is nice! Everyone seems to get along! People are tolerant! People who... have jumped to conclusions can redeem themselves! Nobody is nobody's bitch. I hope that this scared you. And from me, Prison Mike, to you, I just wanna thank you for listening to me. Letting me be a part of your life today. 'Cause you got a good life! YOu got a good life. A good life.  So. What do you think? It doesn't sound so great, does it?
Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Andy. Tanks.
Gruel. Sandwiches. Gruel omelettes. Nothing but gruel. Plus, you can eat your own hair.
And I nevah got caught, neither.
I stole. ... And I robbed. And I kidnapped... the... president's son. And held him for ransom.
And prison. Eh, fifty-fifty, both. Look, prison stinks, is what I'm saying. It's not like you can go home, and, recharge your batteries, and come back in the morning and, be with your friends, having fun in the office. J
Do you really expect me to not push you up against the wall, beeyotch?!  You, my friend, would be da belle of da ball. Don't drop the soap! Don't drop the soap!
Okay nutcases, get out of there! Good work. Long day. Really long. Why don't you guys head home. Early. Time off for good behavior! Heh. Good job. Enjoy your freedoms!
Okay. You know what Toby? I am teaching them a lesson, so.
They were very disrespectful to me, and to the office. And Martin has had a bad influence, to think that I gave him the benefit of the doubt.
Yes?  Oh Pam, that is so sweet. You didn't have to do that. P
Umm... I don't know? Average kind?
I'm looking for the toy drive box. P
Not as much as I need a moment alone with you.  Berp.
Turn around, turn around. Come on.
Hey, everybody. I don't know who you haven't met yet, but I think this is one of them. This is my girlfriend - Carol. This is just the front of her. Show 'em, show 'em the other side. C
There she is. A Christmas Carol. Hello  C
That is my Christmas card. It's a picture of you and me and your kids on a ski trip, having a blast. Ski-sons Greetings. C
No, Carol. You walk out that door and it is over. C
And it's all inclusive. C
No, no no no Ok, OK, You know what, you're not thinking straight. You know what you need? You need to think this through in  Jamaica's largest fresh water pool. C
Well, you know what Phyllis? All of your guests would have probably canceled at the last minute anyway, leaving your life a stupid rotten mess.
Fine!  Have your party. Just no guests. P
Carol and I split up. Amicably. And I just don't think it would be appropriate to celebrate under the circumstances. J
Jim, take New Year's away from Stanley.
It's all...  OK.
Take it from Toby.
I don't have to buy it. I just want to taste it. I just... I just want a little taste of it. D
C'mon Jim, let's go.
Ok, feel better.
Ah, I need my entourage  Jim. Dwight. Ryan. C'mon, we're going to Asian Hooters. R
And I used to say "Hey, got latte?" And she'd say, that's not funny. D
She would get this little foam mustache... D
Dwight, just, just leave them alone please. They're on a date. They look very happy. A
I'm just gonna call her.
You're right. That's good.
Oh, sure you would. Look at you, I bet you break up with a guy every hour.
I don't know. No one can hear me. You know what? Start the party. A
Excuse me  Family style. J
You know what we should do?
We're going to ...
Shhh... Shut it! C'mon! Party.
Oh, party in the break room! Let's go, let's go! Thank God! Let's go to the break room. A
The giant baby. Wow, I am so sorry, I had no idea this party would be so lame.
What're you talking about?
Do you agree about what?  Wow. You're  lucky you're so darn cute. Other w
Yeah... well, it's been hard, they're wearing the exact same uniform. And I've been drinking. And you know how all waitresses look alike.
It's... it's one of those two.
Check her out. My little gal over there. Babe-alectable.
Oh, good. That felt good. Let's go. Party.
Haha, I do! I just haven't hugged you in awhile Second C
You want help? OK... Merry Christmas. Second C
Hey, hey, you. How are ya?Second C
I had rebound? Yeah.
Oh, why do I feel like crap?
I, I put a mark on her arm.  So I could tell them apart. I don't... I know, I know. I can't believe I gave her my bike!
I guess, I didn't know her very well. I marked her arm. J
How can you be sure?
Yeah. You know what? I am. I'm gonna call her. That's a good idea. D
Sounds good. Okay, let's go.
He is also in an interracial relationship, so, you know, if you have any problems, you can always call him. S
You are not as much fun as your Jamaican brothers... mon.
Well, I am just getting settled in. So, I'm gonna... S
OK, well payroll is in charge of all that.
Stanley. You know what? It is really good to see you, too.
It was so good. Oh, Hey mon! At Sandals, Jamaica, when somebody says "Hey mon," everybody says "Hey mon" back.
Just relax, OK? I'll get to all of it later. P
Inventory's at the end of December. P
Yeah... Gosh. Great. You know what, Pam? Make a note. I want us all to start having pina coladas every day at three.
Got to see how Jamaicans live. It is great, you know. They just relax, they party all the time. P
You know, I had never been out of the country before now?
No, no, no. No, that's a German woman named Urkel Grue.
OK. Well, check this out. I am sending you some email. You got it?
Well I'm looking at a photo, right now. And I'm telling 'ya, could be in Maxim. P
And you sent that out to everyone?
OK. Um, well, did you get the second email that I sent? Explaining that the first email was a mistake and that you should delete it. D
OK. Well, that was supposed to go to Packer, not "packaging." Did you already, um, forward to a whole bunch of people? D
That's great, OK. Um, so did you get an email from me?
OK, Hey, man, how's it going? D
A sensitive email has been released to the office. It contains a file, a picture. The file name is "Jamaican Jan Sun Princess."
I bet you would love all the details, wouldn't you? Skeevy little perv.
Aww, none of your business. T
Not now, not ever.
She bought it?  OK. OK.
Oh, God, no. No, no! Hang up! Hang up! Tell her I'm not here. Tell... tell her, I ran out for cash. I hit a deer. I hit a deer with my car. Tell her I hit a cat. Tell her I hit a cat.
Oh. God. No, no, no, no, no.
There an accident? Somebody hurt?
My point is that, if you get it, I would ask that you just delete it. Sight unseen. Let's be professional, all right?
No, Kevin. A woman. Maybe Jan, maybe... J
Did she say what it's about?
Island living. You know?
And I, to you, in addition, feel the same feelings that you are as well. J
I just got back from vacation, mon, all right? So chill. Let's don't... Don't harsh my mellow, mon.
Dwight, please, please.
Me had an i-rey time.
Yeah, mon. Me just got back to the office.
Stanley, I got you some ganja. I'm just kidding. It's coffee. I bet you wish it was ganja.
Go ahead. Let me know if I miscalculated the size. I don't think I did.
Try it on.
I'm just kidding. Coconuts for your coconuts!
Yes, you did. Okay. Oh, Pam, I forgot to get you something.
You are so welcome, mon. Angela, you just got leied.
Andy, I got you a genuine Jamaican T-shirt. They love Milli Vanilli down there.
His name is Bavon. And you know what? I'm sure Bavon gets sick of his job, too. I'm sure he would like to take a day off. I'm sure he would like to spend a vacation selling paper, but he has the right attitude. And that is something that you learn when you go to Jamaica, and you really apply yourself.
Hey, can we just focus?
Oh, that's red eye.
Her passwords aren't going to be Dwight, Dwight. That's stupid. Okay.
Okay. Well, Jan's email password is not Dunder Mifflin, Sandals, Jamaica, Michael, Michael Scott, Jan Scott, or Mrs. Jan Scott.
Yes, good luck with that.
It is Jamaican. The exchange rate is 65-to-1. I don't remember in which direction.
Oh, that is gross.
You know what? Get Pam.
Sorry, oh wow, that's so rude. I'm sorry, I can't control him.
You can't pass. You've got to pick somebody.
Good. Next up, Superfly himself, Stanley.
Well, I appreciate that. That is very gracious of you. A
Yes. Ok, here is the dream team. My sales dream team. Today we are going to team up for sales calls. Andy, since this was your idea, you get to pick first.
Whoah, whoah. Oh hahahaha. Vamanos!
It's just... brrrrrr... It's "Amazing Race," Phyllis. Okay? We're in teams of two and we are on a mission. All right, so, on your mark, get set, go. Let's do it.
Just bragging rights.
No, we're just going to rush out, do the sales thing, and come back. R
Long story. All right everybody, circle up. Here we go. You know what this is? This is the "Amazing Race."  And you guys are the gay couple. And we are the firefighter heroes. Are we ready to go?
Here ya go.
Ugh... that is a long story. Um, couple of months ago, Dwight tried to go behind my back with Jan and get my job and I am now having him do my laundry as punishment. A
I don't know. Who knows how words are formed.
No, you are remembering it wrong.
He didn't say.
I knew it.
I know that you went to corporate this morning, and I know that you lied about it. And given our history, I need you tell me this instant exactly what you were doing. D
Where were you this morning?
But, there is some good news. Oscar is back. Addition by addition. So we are going to have a big party today to welcome him back and hopefully that will lift everybody's spirits.
What does that even mean? That is impossible.
I said 'was'.
I don't know. Maybe.
Yeah, do you?
Really? That was very nice of him. We need more attitude like that around the office. A
Yeah. And you know what? Ask them about the toys on my desk too. They always used to arrange them in a very pleasing way. It used to brighten my morning.
Ah, a burro, of course. If Oscar wants a donkey, let's get him one.
No, no, no. I mean, not because you're gay. Your gayness does not define you. Your Mexican-ness is what defines you to me. And I think we should celebrate Oscar's Mexicanity. So Phyllis... I want you to go find firecrackers. And a Chihuahua. Pam, in the frozen food section, Swanson makes a delightful chimichanga.
No, hey, hey. Don't be ridiculous. Of course we are going to have a party. A celebration of Oscar. Oscar night. And I want it to be Oscar-specific. O
Don't - don't do that. That's not nice. What about you, Phyllis? You and Dwight were close.
Yes, he did. Have any of you talked to Dwight? S
Do you think that anyone else out there would have driven to corporate for you?
Why would Dwight do that for you? I think I know why. Because Dwight loves this company.
No. I don't want to do any of that.
So, maybe you should come back. You should come back. Please. D
How's this place treating you?
Yes, she did. And Dwight, if you were willing to do something like that for some random co-worker, then clearly I have misjudged you from the beginning, and I apologize.
Okay, Dwight, you can let go of her hand. You're gonna break it.  Not bad, huh?
Ladies and gentlemen! May I present... Mr. Dwight Schrute!
Wow. Thank you. Wow, that's-- thanks so much.
How, would you stop interrupting please?
We will demonstrate on Pam.
Well you get the picture.  Thanks Pam.
Okay.  From the top.  Ready?  Three-
You know what, Dwight, do you want to do this, or no?
He's not going to be a murderer.
No problem.  The guys are having a little shindig of their own in the warehouse.  From 2:30 to 3:15.  It is the only time that Bob was available.  Sort of a guy's night out.  A G-N-O if you will.  A Gah-No.  Actually, it's more of a guy's afternoon in.  A G-A-I.  A gay.  Not- not- it's uh, not gay, it's just a, it's a bridal shower for guys.  A guy shower.  An hour long shower with guys.
No, no, no!
Yes.  Yes!  Oh!  There-oh!
So that's what that means.
I can't get a stripper here.  Sexual Harassment.
Um, not personally, no.
I did not order a stripper.
It's the only time he can do it.  2:30 to 3:15.  It's going to be great.  We're going to be doing some darts, we're going to be grilling up some steaks, got some pie.  Going to be very delicious.
You should get out of them.
Okay.  Co-ed naked strippers in this office.  For realsies.
Well get on it.  And make it happen.
And you think that'd be sexy?
I'm in the, I'm in the sex shop.
You wearing a thong?Ben F
Oh.  Hello!Ben F
Yeah, alright, so I want you to give him your undivided attention and Mr. Franklin, if any of these ladies misbehave I give you permission to spank them.  Especially that one.
And when they came over on the Mayflower.  Bow chicka bow.
Yes, but, Ben Franklin was.Ben F
He's in his knickers.  Mr. Franklin, I would say you are probably one of the sexiest presidents ever.Ben F
Half pants, right Mr. Franklin?Ben F
Hello ladies.  Who here is a history buff?  Who's a fan of buff naked?  Without further ado, the one, the only, the sexy Mr. Benjamin Franklin.Ben F
But I got all the foot off of it.
Well then my man meat, he shall have.  There you go.  Deliciousity.
Nice outfit. E
Ah, gentlemen, the entertainment is here.  Everybody I'd like to introduce you to Elizabeth.
I call shuffle.  Here we go.
Yeah she probably, yeah she would be.  You know what, okay, excuse me.  Please stop it, stop it. Turn off the music.  This is wrong, this is wrong!  This is wrong!  I have a girlfriend.  And you are engaged and I'm sure you have a boyfriend in prison or something so lets just clear out okay.  Shame on you.  Go back to work!
You smell like Tide detergent.  Do you use Tide detergent?  Ha ha ha!  I have a girlfriend so...
Not bad! Not bad!  You smell nice.  Like Tide.
Here we go.  Alright!
Okay.  Alright, I'll do it.  Yeah.  Lets do it.  Lets do this thing.  Yeah.  What do I?
He's right there.  There he is.Bob V
Well, Ben Franklin, you're really kind of a sleezebag.
Wow.  Thank you.
Yes. I kind of arranged it.
No, today at work.
I went to a bachelor party and things got a little out of hand.
Not really, look I don't know how to say this so I just will.
You are.  You are.
That is so sweet.  You are the best GD girlfriend in the world.  Do you know that?
Just cover up that bald patch.
Okay... umm... I'm sure that Bob... Wow. That is... that is pungent. I lost my train of thought. Aaah... Are you set on that hairstyle?
You're probably worried about pleasing Bob. A lot of pressure. Phyllis, did you break wind? It's okay, if you did. It's a very natural reaction. It's your wedding. And you're nervous... P
Me, too. If you need to vomit, that is ok. I did. Do you want to talk about tonight?
How you doin'? You excited.
Long story s
I hate you!
This is bull****!
Ladies and Gentleman, for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance.  Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you for the first time as a couple, Mr. and Mrs. Bob Vance!
Agreed. No fingers will be laid on Phyllis.  Oh, decided to sit down again, huh? Great. Bet you can hear me, too.
I will take care of that.
I'm already on it. The chicken? Totally undercooked. I sent it back.
Thank you, Randy. That was great. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hi, I'm Michael Scott and for the next forty minutes, I'm going to be your tour guide through the lives of Phyllis Lapin and Bob Vance.  One of the great, seemingly impossible, love stories of our time. My name is Michael Scott. Webster's Dictionary defines "wedding" as the fusing of two metals with a hot torch. Well, you know something. I think you guys are two metals. Gold medals. For those of you who don't know me, I'm Michael Scott, Phyllis' boss. To quote from The Princess Bride "Mawige...
Oh. Yeah. You're out of here! You're... Yeah. I hate you!
Ok. All right.Bob V
No. I'm not going to... Bob V
is a guy that... Bob V
Look, I just wanted to go in and quietly sit and have a piece of cake. I'm not even going to dance one song.
Dwight, just... D
Dude, keep it together. I listened to you for half an hour even though most of that stuff went right over my head.
Yes. Yes. They were. Robert Parrish! I should talk to her. I don't want this to ruin her honeymoon.Uncle A
We are great together. We are a great team.Uncle A
You're... You're welcome.
Yeah. Yeah. He's kind of a weirdo.
In business school, Kevin. Business school. K
Today's a special day, because I am being honored as a... visiting... professor, special lecturer, emeritus... how did you, how did you...
Why is today a special day?
Pop quiz. K
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm just saying if they did throw their hats I've got a great line for t
A lot of times, at a... school, or naval academy, after a rousing speech, the crowd would throw its hats high into the air.
Hello everyone, I am Michael Scott. And I would like to start today by inspiring you. May I borrow someone's textbook, please? Thank you. What have we here? Ooh. Economics. Very, very interesting.  I know these are expensive, um, but the lesson is priceless. Good. Alright. I think you're inspired. Shall we proceed? There are four kinds of b
Thanks, Kowalsky. Um, can we get on track here? Business Student #1: By your own employee's calculation you'll be obsolete in the next five to ten years. M
Nice try, how's your Pollack-says-what index? Business Student #3: ...What?
...We don't want them back, 'cause they're... stupid. Business Student #3: How far has your Herfindahl index declined since the merger?
You heard me, pack your things.
Business is always personal. It's the most personal thing in the world. When we get back to the office, pack your things.
A good manager doesn't fire people. He hires people and inspires people. ... People, Ryan. And people will never go out of business.
Fire you? No, no no. You are moving... to the annex.
...Chunky. Do you want half?
That is our building... and we sell paper. ... I am really proud of you.
Well, yeah. Yeah, we have to have it for the office. I mean, there's my... window, and there's my car! That your car?
I don't see a... price. P
My God, these could be tracings! Ohh! Look at this one. Wow! You nailed it.  ... How much?
Wow! You did these... freehand?
OK. Do you want me to repeat that?
This... You know this is a scale of one to ten?
Just getting warmed up. Mistakes are just successes that you mess up.
Don't do what I say, say what I do.
No, it's just mileage mostly, but there's one chapter that I call wisdoms. I'm going to read you a series of statements, and I want you to tell me, on a scale of one to ten, how smart they are.
Oh, umm, ever since I started here, I've kept a diary of all my sales.
Wow! That's a lot of books, do you have, umm, one book that sums up all of these.
That's, yep a little flimsy. Umm... OK... Ahh... Alright, no more desks. Oh OK.
How can I put this? That question makes you sound gay.
Bop bop de Bope bop bop bop bop bop. You only have me for a limited time... Yes.Student 3: Do you believe your high fixed cost are warranted given your diminishing market share.
OK.Student 2: ... email...
Very good.Student 2: In the digital age...
OK.Student 2: New question.
No no no no no. Never follow, always lead.Student 2: OK.
Oh, Oh, I take umbrage to that premise...ses. Umm, let me ask you t
And now, the chains.
No. Alright, this is getting hot. So let's just do this. Ok, ready? Three, two, one, go.
No. No. Everyone, now count down with me. THREE!
Ready? Come on guys. Early worm gets the worm. J
Play some games?
Go in together, could save some gas, have some fun, long trip.
Sure? Might be a good idea.
Ummm... I don't know.
Uh, yes you are.
That's what she said.
I am on my way. I should be there in about 15...
I don't care. Oh, wow. Here. Don't put my jacket. Don't give me that.
Shut up. Ok, change shirts with me.
Thank you. D
Oh, you probably want to leave the cover on until the guests get here.
You don't have to, Jan. This contract says it all.
It's a heart.
Jan and I are lovers. It feels so good to finally say that out loud.
Rachel. Boy, you clean up good. Place looks great with all the lights on. And everything.  Actually looks bigger with people in it. It's weird. So...
David, how much did this house cost?
Dwight, wow. That's not appropriate.
Bagel bites or something. K
I could go for an appeteaser. J
It did. Like butter. Mike Myers, SNL. You should ask Karen, she was one of them. K
How about some Splenda?
Yeah. Do you have any ice?
Yes, but you could tell me. What... What is that? Why are you? Why are we going in the bathroom? I thought this is where you liked your privacy. J
What are you doing?
Ok. Excuse me. What's going on? What is it?
You and the misses should join us at Sandals Jamaica next Christmas. J
You're acting inappropriate. Jan.
I'm not going to slam you up against the wall. J
No, no, no, means please don't. Please.
Don't take that dress. Stop it, Jan.
Come on, let's go back to the party. J
No, no, no.
That's all, you didn't mean it?
I want the house, Jan. I want the picket fence. I want the ketchup fights and the tickling, and the giggling.
I'm not going to cry. I feel like it but I am not going to. Why don't you just take your stupid love contract and tear it up into a million little pieces. J
Well, if that's the way you feel, my lady, then you have hurt me greatly. J
You didn't have any of the potato salad did you?
I don't... remember.
No, he has been wanting a raise for a couple of months and he's just using this Roy thing as leverage.  J
It was a crime of passion, Jan, not a disgruntled employee. Everyone here is extremely gruntled.  J
Oh it... sounded interesting... what you were gonna...
No, what did you say?
Go ahead, ask me for a raise.
Walking out of the room unexpectedly. J
Ok, let's try another one.  Um...
By leaning back, and by whispering, I established a dominant physical position.  J
Ok, see what I did?
What I'm saying is that,
Hmm, well that's interesting Darryl.  I think...
No, you know what?  Let's stay here.  No let's go... Yeah let's go to the conference room.
You know what?  Actually, let's go into the conference room.
Yes, yeah, absolutely.  Have a seat.
No, I do, I, I wear men's suits, OK?  I got this out of a bin.
Alright, you know what?  Pam, could you please tell Darryl that this is not a woman's suit?  P
I do not buy woman's clothes.  I would not make that mistake again.  D
No, this is a power suit.  D
Hmm.  Ohh, Darryl.  You are a good worker, and a good man.  I just, you know, times are tight.  And I just don't think corporate is going to go for this right now.  D
Italians don't wear pockets.
No, they don't.  See?
It's European, OK?  It's a European cut.
Would you stop it, please? J
Uh,  MISSterious.  And it is mysterious because the buttons are on the wrong side... that's the mystery.
Um, let's just do this in 15 minutes.
You make a very compelling argument.
That was a very good point.
Plus perks, yes.
I don't.  Want me to prove it to you?  There is... a pay stub.
I... I can't give you that, I--- I don't make this much.
Oh.  Come on.  Be serious.
Because, that is the way these things are done.  In... films.  No, slide--- slide it, yes.
I didn't give you $40.
Oh, thank you.
I am makin' it happen, sergeant.
You know what?  I deserve a bump.
I have been a loyal employee for a long time.  D
You know what?  I should.
I'm not gonna go out and ask for a raise right now.  That is ridiculous. D
Well what am I supposed to do?
I talked to corporate, and they told me that I can only give you a 5% raise.
Okay.  Okay, here's the straight... dope.  No tricks.  No Wikipedia.
No, Toby is terrible.  Toby is the worst human being I've ever known. J
Yes, I'm bringing Darryl.
Yshhyah.  Um, yeah.  I'll leave right away.
No, Jan.  I've never asked for a raise in 14 years.  This is long overdue.  I wanna do it today.  J
Where?  I'm gonna smack you in the head with a hammer.  Come on, let's go.
Toby, come on.  Let's go.
Maybe I'll stay.
Mm, the Big Apple.
Don't ever touch a black man's radio!  ...Chris Tucker.  Rush Hour.  I won't touch yours, by the way.
Pippity poppity, give me the zoppity.  D
No.  You gonna play it like this?  You give me a good raise, or no more sex.  What are you writing, perv-ball? T
I got you... jade earrings.  J
Six percent?  After all we've been through?
Be nice to get a memo, we are lovers.
Were you going to tell me that you hired James Van Der Beek?
Who's the boy toy?
Okay, no, no, no, no.  You do not try tactic number eight on me.  I invented tactic number eight.  I'm not going anywhere.
But you just said 15.
Ah, so...  All right, Levinson.  Here's the rub.  I would like a 15% raise.
Well that's ridiculous I'm not gonna make---
Ohh.  It was a weird day.  I accidentally cross-dressed.  And then Darryl made me feel bad for not making any money.  And then I had to ride up here with stupid Toby.  And then, your assistant, is all young and hot.  And I---
Okay.  Um, her.
I thought your name was Pudge?
Guys, I'm not the only one who's driven the forklift.   Pudge has driven the forklift.
I can, and I have.
...would I go near---
Okay, okay!  I got it.  I got it.  ...  Only on the rarest of occasions...
It's a big red trash compactor!
Yes, yes.  But it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world... if somebody...
Bail'er?  I hardly know her.
Okay.  ... What, Nerf isn't cool anymore?
Darryl, I did not walk out in the middle of yours.  So, I---
Mmmm, no, no, it's... sedentary...
Yes.  Okay, let's do another one.  This is a good one.  "A particular concern for office workers is a sedimentary life style, which can contribute---"
Ok guys, you know what?  I didn't--- I didn't interrupt when you were having your presentation.
Ok, you know what?  I think that everybody is going to vomit due to boredom.   Um, let's see.  "Seasonal affective disorder!  A depression that includes weight gain, fatigue, irritability, brought on by the low light of winter."
Ok, you know what?  You're making it sound kind of lame. So, skip ahead to the really dangerous stuff.  Like sometimes computers can explode, can they not?
Wow, that is... that time really adds up.  That's like... a half an hour, every hour?
Yes, good.  Fine.  Like stretching and...
Yeah... you are... ah, so right.  They had visual aids.  And all we had were the facts.  You don't go to the science museum and get handed a pamphlet on electricity.  You go to the science museum and you put your hand on a metal ball, your hair sticks up straight... and you know science.
I--- I---  Nobody commits suicide because they work with a baler, and yet those guys are makin' fun of me, calling me a Nerf, that...
Working in an office can lead to depression.  Which can lead to suicide.  I mean this is really serious stuff.
I don't know, I don't know.  Because you know what our killer is?  Depression---
Go buy some watermelons.
Maybe we should test it first.  Letterman-style.  Throw a TV over, or...
Have Pa--adge do it, or... the sea monster.
Also, take apart the trampoline, stick it in the baler.
Find out whose car that is.  If it's Stanley's, call the offices of James P. Albini, see if he handles hate crimes.
BINGO!  WHOA WHOA WHOA!  Oh... crap.  Deactivate the car alarm.  Clean up the mess.
Let's do it!  Drop that sucker. D
I am ready to do this!  I am ready to make a point!
That's right!  I am not thinking.
Rock n' roll!
No.  No more.  The tests are going terrible.  If we keep doing it, we're not gonna want to jump.  This is about doing, not thinking.
I don't know if I wanna do this.
That's the whole point, dummy.
Wait, where are the warehouse guys?
Yes!  My head is in such pain!  And turmoil!
Dwight, you ignorant slut.  Depression is a very serious illness.  Over 32 thousand people commit suicide every year!  According to a 2004 study!
Everything's wrong.  The stress of my modern office, has caused me to go into a depression.
My life!  Oh, my life...
Dwight, you ignorant slut.
Everything is wrong, Dwight.  The stress of my modern office, has made me depressed.
Oooooh, my life!
And that is why, I am going to jump off this roof!
Okay.  Pam, I'm coming down to get my present.
I Braveheart.  I am.
I'm braver than you?
Do you really mean that?
It's complicated with Jan.  And I don't know where I stand, or what I want.  The sex isn't nearly as good as it used to be.
What do I have to live for?
You told me, that I lead a... cushy, wimpy, Nerf life.
Dwight, you are such a liar.  Pam, really, what is it?
Dwight, find out what the present is.
What is it?
Don't worry Pam, you will be answering phones for the rest of your life... Your long lovely life.  saved it.
I've been told that I'm a tactile learner.
Learn by touching.
Like we're going to the science museum.
Sum it up Darryl, sum it up.
Kelly, Ryan looks great. You should be thankful that you...
... because they had a much scarier safety presentation.
... Dwight, they embarrassed us...
It was the warehouse guys...
But it was not a fair fight.
OK, good. Thank you. Wanna take our time, do this right.
You know Drew, why don't you go inside. Dwight come here. Where should we put this?
I will miss you the most Ryan.
I'm going to wait. I don't want to say this twice, it's too painful and I'm too depressed.
It is disgusting.  I totally agree.  Well, we're going to recalling all of that paper.
Creed.  Quality assurance.  Your job.  I really think you screwed the pooch on one, Creed.  Because of you, the entire company is in jeopardy.
You know what? Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh!  Forget it.  Where is Creed?
To save time, Jim.
Front and Center. Twice as fast as you would normally go.  Any other questions?
Crisis Management Squad.
Midnight, Oscar!  Don't worry, Kelly will be training you first.
No, Pam.  The press is just gonna find out by themselves.
No, no.  I need two men on this.  That's what she said.  No time!  But she did.  NO TIME!  Guys, get on this.  Dwight, I want you to be in charge of the press conference.
No, sweet cheeks.  We need someone who's actually made a sale.  Andy, you go.
I want you to bring a partner.
No, no, no, no.  Not good enough.  This is a keystone account.  I want you in the school.  In person.
Here is your headline. "Scranton Area Paper Company, Dunder Mifflin, apologizes to valued client.  Some companies still know how business is done."  Okay?  Battle stations everybody, let's go, go, go, go, go, go!
Well, we are extremely sorry.
I know, I know you're angry.  And we are truly, truly sorry.
So, let us consider this matter ended.
The watermark... it's a one time thing.
Yeah, well I'm calling the Ungrateful Bi-atch Hotline!  Did you get all that?Chad L
Doesn't matter.  Out please!
That's insane.  We'll give this to somebody who will appreciate it.
No--- my--- OK, this is insane.  You can get out of here.  Get out!
No, I'm a regional manager---
I'm the head of the company?!
The guys at the papermill--- No no no!
Well...  OK, well...  Um, wasn't really my fault.  The guys at the papermill---
You're right.  It will blow over.  But it's not... going to take... a week or two.   Do you know what this is for?
No, then Newsweek picks it up.  And then CNN does a story about it.  Then... YouTube gets a hold of it...
I'm asking Pam to do it, please.
So I'll know where--- P
Do you think you're taking it a little... literally, Dwight?  And now we're wasting tape.  I'm gonna have to cut this all out.  Can you say cut?
I understand that, Dwight.
That's how devoted I am to this job.
Thought so too.
That's... they always give an ultimatum.
You understand? You... you get this check.Barbara A
All right. We are infinitely sorry.Barbara A
I'm sorry.Barbara A
Okay. We good? Okay, that's enough Aqua Net.
Okay. Am I shiny?
Uh-huh. Prove it. Let's see your penis. I... you know, as that was coming out of my mouth, I knew that it was wrong.
Incidentally, where were you during all of this? Maybe you're the flasher.
Oh, come on.  We are laughing at Phyllis, but she's not even here, so no harm, no foul.
Oh, Phyllis got flashed. It's, uh...
Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus?
I'm sorry. It's pretty funny when you think about it.
Um... I mean did he even see Pam? Or, uh... Karen from behind?  K
Really? Is she OK?
I... uh, well, I don't know.
Um, that... I don't know. That makes me kind of uncomfortable.
I don't know. I feel... I drive a lot. I'm spending a fortune on gas and tolls -
Dwight, are those your pants? That's a Polaroid.
This is the last thing that Phyllis needs to see right now, Dwight.
You know what? I am the expert. I will conduct it. I know the crap out of women.
That is not current.
Oh, I don't know, James. Did I come from a woman? Have I slept with a woman? More than one?
No, Dwight. Respect. R-E-S-P-svee-T. Find out what it means to me. All right, you know what? That's it. Conference room, five minutes. Women's appreciation.
See? That's what we're talking about. Did you hear that, Dwight?
OK, you know something, Dwight? We are not the terrorists. Why don't you just take these women, put 'em in a burlap sack, and hit 'em with a stick? Because that's what you're doing. I celebrate these women. They deserve the right to dress as they please. If Pam wants to show more cleavage, she should be able to. I encourage that.
I have to know whether you're serious or not.
Because wha... that was one possible explanation as to why you got that haircut.
No. I'm being misogynistic. That is insane. I am not being sexist.
Yes. Thank you. That was not necessary, but I appreciated it. And I proves my point. Women can do anything.
What are...? Shut it. Shut. Up. OK, so what I want to engage us in today is a hardcore discussion about women's problems and issues and situations. Magazines and TV shows and movies portray women as skinny, tall goddesses. Well, look around. Are women like that? No. No, they are not.  Even the hot ones aren't really that skinny. So what does that say? That says that you women are up against it. And it is criminal. Society doesn't care. Society sucks. I don't even consider myself a part of society. FYI. Because I am so angry over all of this.
OK, no catfights. Please. Let's - my point is... my point is... a penis, when seen in the right context, is the most wonderful sight for a woman. But in the wrong context, it is like a monster movie.
Nobody likes to be flashed. When Meredith flashed me at that Christmas party, I nearly vomited.
You're right. You're right, you're right. And you know why? It's because of where we are. This is a masculine environment. We need to find a place where you feel comfortable. You know where we're gonna go? The Steamtown Mall.
Ye - OK, yes.
Many women are competent drivers.  OK. Come on.
I just... I feel uncomfortable wearing the dress.
Yeah? Well, Jan has this schoolgirl fantasy.
What, um... what do you think of role-play?
Anything you guys want. This is your time.  Mm. What is a Pap smear? Or is it "shmear?" Like the cream cheese.
You're welcome. You're welcome, you're welcome. OK. So, let's dish.
No, she's... she's fooling around. It's a woman thing.
No, it's not that bad. The worst part is that she shows it to her therapist and they discuss it.
And then watching it back right afterward to improve my form.
Jan says anything that doesn't scare us is not worth doing. I don't know. Maybe we're different people. I like cuddling and spooning and she likes videotaping us during sex.
I wanna break up with Jan. Wow. I wanna break up with Jan.
That sounds good too. I don't know who's right. I just don't - I don't know. I don't know.
Yeah, that's smart.
I'm happy sometimes. Um... when we scrapbook or right towards the end of having sex.
I'm unhappy when I'm with her.
She's totally flat. Shrunken chesticles.
Cons. Wears too much makeup. B
OK. Jan is smart. Uh, successful. Good clothes. Hot. Perfect skin. Nice butt.
Oh, hey, guys. I want to do something nice for you, because you did something so nice for me earlier. I want you to go in there. I want you to buy one item on me as a thank-you.  Come on. Get in here.
OK, it stopped.
Oh. Oh, no.   It's Jan. What do I do?
Uh... you know what? I'm going to... you take care of that. I'm gonna do traffic... detail.
Do you have a... a crescent? A crescent Allan?
Yeah, get your hazards on for safety. Let's see.
Uh, yeah. Yep. Um... Could somebody grab me the lever, and I will...
Maybe some Italian.  "who get along. Oh, just so you know, it's not me, it's you. OK, buddy."
OK, buddy. Somebody just walked in. I have to go. Um, so I'll talk to you later.
I love you guys.  Now I'm getting her voicemail.
We should really start recycling.  J
The a cartoon that goes with each article.  This one says Mel Karmazin?  I don't, I don't know. I guess I get it.
Uh, yeah, it's okay. Its just, I don't think the cartoons are very funny.
Uh, yes, I am.
Not it. I don't have eggs.
Just... all over. I don't want to do anything... I'm dying...
OK, everybody out. Out. Out. Out. OK.
The CFO? Ohh...
May God guide you in your quest.
Wow. I wish I had prepared something to say.
...you just gots to get your freak on.
Oh, you sigh like Jan. I broke Jan's heart, David, and it was awful. It was... It was never my intention to ruin a life. But you know what? Sometimes...
And Gromit.  Jan? Is Jan there?
Well, you can't swim in leather pants.  I'm just yankin' your chain.  Not literally.
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, Toby. We... um... Somebody has to stay here.
Oh, you know what? Uh, you're not going. T
We are. We are. But, I would like you to take notes. And I want you to find out about people's character. Not their hotness, per se, but their humor, and their charisma, and the indefinable quality that makes you all glad to follow me.
Hey Pam, I have a very important job for y
Well write it down before you forget it. That's... You've just been drawing pictures.  Rrrr. I can't stay mad at you.
Like everything I said and everything they did and... Just don't...
Well,  Hey Pam, did you get that down? P
Okay, you know what? Your enthusiasm's turning people off.
Or the front of the bus. Or drive the bus.  Just, we are all participating in mandatory fun activities.  Funtivities!  And there is a special secret prize for the winner!
If you don't like it, Stanley, you can go to the back of the bus.
Choose your tribes. Except for Pam. Not Pam.
Just words. Inspiring words.  For the competitions, you will be divided into four tribes. Each tribe will have a leader that I will pick randomly off the top of my head without thinking. Jim, Dwight, Andy and Stanley.
I'm not playing.
Then I will name your team the Red team. S
Shh... The person carrying the egg will be blindfolded. Please put on your blindfolds. That person carrying the egg will go down, circle a torch, come back, deposit their egg in the pail. First team back is the winner. Alright. Ready? Set. Go!
Thanks a bunch.
The winner of today gets my job. Ok? I'm interviewing for a job at corporate. And they're only interviewing a handful of people and I'm the most qualified and I'll probably get it. Alright? D
The winner gets a regional manager's salary for a year, and a Sebring, and the feeling that they are making a difference in the world.
I can't say. J
Come on, the winner gets a big, big prize.
No mustard, no mustard. Just eat it, eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it'll slide down your gullet more easily.
Guys, guys, guys. Come on! Pleeeeease... Let's just... OK, it's very important that you all try to eat as many hot dogs as you can. On your mark. Get set. Eat!
No, I have the only one. I claimed it. Ready?
13 hot dogs, everybody!
One. Two. Three. D
Blah, blah, blee blup, blup, okay? This is about guts. It takes guts to be a regional manager. Jim, you're up. J
Wait! Am I going on go? Or am I going on three? C
Yes. Count to three, please. G
Alright. Okay. Alright. Fine. 'kay.  Okay. P
Oh, I love that movie. Yes, Kelly is right, the person to replace me has to have a great sense of humor and they have to possess the leadership qualities of a Bynes or a Hope.  So without further ado, Jim and Dwight show us what you got. J
Yeah.  Ummm, hmm... True.  Look, I don't want to leave this branch that I love to an outside hire therefore we are going to have a one hundred point winner take all sudden death tribal council round. To test the aspect of my job that I think is the most important, something I call the Bob Hope factor. K
No. No, no, no. No guests today. Classic gang only. Just us good friends, and Karen and Andy.
Then, Mr. Driver, we are off like a herd of turtles! Johnny Carson.
Here we go. Come on. Okay, everybody here?
It's a bus that takes you to a party. Here we go.
No. We're only 10 minutes from the lake.
...I'm never gonna tell you anything ever again. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
You are really annoying me. If you don't knock it off...
No, we are not.
Very good, Jim. Pam, please note that Jim is very astute. All right, are we ready?
Yes, for dramatic affect.
Okay, all right.
Exactly. Are you sure you're doing that right? Taking an awfully long time.
But they didn't complete their task, Pam! If people can't carry an egg in a spoon, blindfolded, then what does that tell you about how they will be able to manage a sales report, or conduct a business call?
Because he wasn't following the rules.
Ryan, I want to see you with a hot dog in your mouth. Right now.
Come on, Ryan...
Who's got the hungry?
No, no, no, no, not that--- just... come on, you guys, let's do it! I'm serious. Who's got the hungry?
No mustard! No mustard! Just... eat it. Eat it, Phyllis. Dip it in the water so it will slide down your gullet more easily.
Son of a bitch. God! Okay. All right you know what? Here we go. On your mark! Get set!
Don't try to flirt your way into this. Sometimes you really creep me out.
You? You haven't made a sale.
Are we all set? D
Moon each other. J
No, um, well I was thinking that uh, actually we could all leave tomorrow and do a convoy you know?  Convoys are really fun.  Pull up next to each other, give each other the finger... J
I have to buy another place.
No, no, no. You know what? It's a done deal. I basically have the job already. There's nothing she can do to stop it now. I already sold my condo.
Let's get back together.
First got priorities.
No, no, no, just... that's not his real name.  That's just what I call him, so...
That is Beardy.
I have been here a bunch of times, so I know where everything is, know everybody's names.  If you need to know somebody's name, just ask me.
Oh, and Hunter?  Could you tell her,  "Brbrbrbrbr!" also?
Could you give her a message for me, when she gets in?
Jan in yet?
Well, my weaknesses are actually... strengths.
Why don't I tell you what my greatest weaknesses are?  I work too hard.  I care too much.  And sometimes I can be too invested in my job.
Good to see you.  Here are the post-merger performance stats that you asked for.
I don't understand. So, we're gonna tag team it?
Yes.  And I am very excited about the prospect of working under her... or on top of her.  Mm, that's not sexual, just... we're all professionals.
It is always a treat when our paths cross.  So, oh!  Before I forget, I wanted to let you know, if you hadn't already heard, uh, Jan and I are back together.  So... I may need to fill out one of those love documents again.
I've never been a big fan of the name Dunder Mifflin.  I was thinking we could name the company something like, "Paper Great.  Where great paper is our passion.  We're GRRRRRRRRRREAT!"  I don't know, could be good.  Or, uh, "Super Duper Paper.  It's super duper."  I don't know, something like that.
I can't tell you.
Daaah, let's just run away together.  Let's just run away to Jamaica and live in a bungalow.  You have some savings right?  You could pay off my debts.  It would... be fine.  We'd have fun. J
Cool.  Maybe you should do it sooner rather than later.
Could have gone better I guess.
David, I did not tell her.
No--- We're all unstable.
Hey!  You're  unstable!
Wuuuoooh, hey, whoa, Jan---
Good.  That's all I ever wanted.  These two.  Either one of them... excellent candidates.
Good.  Very good.  I'm glad we are finally on the same page.  Still have my job in Scranton, though.
You know what?  That... is actually good... because, um, I don't think I could take... my girlfriend's job.  That's not being a good boyfriend.  So, I respectfully withdraw my name from consideration.  Do you accept my withdrawal?
Good, I'm glad we're on the same page.  I have a lot of ideas for new directions.
So, I am gonna... give her a ride home.  Let me know about the job.
Probably get some negative feedback on my eBay profile.
Well, it's...  No, don't cry, it's gonna be OK.
I know.  I know, I'm sorry about that.  That was terrible.
No.  No, Pam.  I'm baaaaaack!  For gooood!  Kevin Nealon.
No, it's for me, bimbo.  Kids.
You shouldn't have taken it.  Bad management!  Good thing I'm baaaaaack.   Ryan, coffee.
Still waitin' on that coffee.
Well, I don't know what it's gonna be called, but... my point is, the future of this company is now.  And the future... is me.
Well,  I've actually done a lot of thinking about that.  And in ten years, I am living in a big house, with my kids.  And in this house we have screens on the walls that have famous art on them and I have a remote that works everything, that has like a belt-loop attachment, or in my ear, like a gluetooth.  And, because it's the future, I can take just a little tiny pill and get all my vitamins for the whole day.
Heart is.  That makes a lot more sense.  You think they'd help each other out like that at corporate?  I think not!
Jan got fired.  And I realized that I could not work for a company that would fire my girlfriend.   But more than that, I realized that... I couldn't take a job that would take me away from this place.  This is where I belong.  This is... my home.  And home is where the hardest.
Gah. Kind of a good news bad news there. I was able to be on the scene so quickly because I was in the car that hit her.
Yes. She has a slight pelvical fracture, but, ah... people have survived far worse.
It happened this morning in the parking lot. I took her to the hospital, and the doctors tried to save her life. They did the best that they could... And she is going to be OK.
It was an accident.
Yeah, it's only Meredith, thank God. But did you see the way they looked at me? Like I was a murderer or something.
Oh, right, I'm sorry. What i
Yes. It was on company property, with company property, so... double jeopardy, we are fine.
No, I was being negligent. But she's in the hospital, she's fine, recovering nicely. Tiny little crack in her pelvis. But she will be up in...
Well, I ran down Meredith in my car.
Everyone inside the car was fine, Stanley!
Yaaaaaay, Pam! Alright, since I am the boss I will drive as well. Who wants shotgun?
Good work Pam.
Ok, good good, so we'll just all go down there together at lunch.
So, like a freedom tree.
No! That is not funny, I love my employees, even thought I hit one of you with my car. For which I take full responsibility. Look I'm just trying to take everybody's mind off of this unavoidable tragedy, and onto more positive things. So I thought we should plant a tree.
Come on. [starts to climb onto the bed with meredith.
Well, just shhhh... just just...
Cause you know what they say in the Bible about forgiveness? Forgiveness is next to Godliness.
Oh, OK... Wait up, wait up, guys guys guys, hold on a second. You know what I was thinking might be sort of fun? Is if you forgave me in front of everybody.
I am going to be sick... I'm gonna puke.
Brought you some balloons. Why don't we... here you go.  Oh! Shhhh... For God's sake!
OK... Meredith,  Ooooohhhhh. I brought all your friends from the office dear.
No... She's in a coma.
No... OK, she always looks like that... That is not my fault.
Oh, sh... I'm sorry Angela. Man what a day huh? How could it get any worse? Her computer crashes with the porn, and then Meredith with the accident, and then... Sprinkles! God, that's 3 things. I'll tell you what's going on. This office is cursed, and we need to do something about it.
OK, you know what? Everybody, let's just get over the whole Meredith thing. She cracked her pelvis, a tiny little crack. She going to be fine, so let's just...
Thank you for the permission. Psych! Alright let's just go around the room, and tell me what you believe in.
Satan is a master of lies. Everything he says is the opposite.
Alright, I would now like to talk about each of your individual religious beliefs.
Well, I think you should go to the hospital, and pay your respects.
Dwight, you haven't seen Meredith yet, have you?
Perfect. So our tragedy is your good luck. Satan.
Like park on it. Or dig up a body... Toby? Anything you want to tell us?
OK, 1 Sikh, and...
What are you?IT Tech G
Are you sure?
Maybe believing in God was the mistake. What did people believe in before? The sun? Maybe there's some sort of animal, that we could make a sacrifice too. Like a giant buffalo, or some sort of monster, like something with the body of a walrus with the head of a sea lion. Or something with the body of an egret with the head of a meerkat. Or just... the head of a monkey, with the antlers of a reindeer, with, ah... the body of a porcupine. J
Turns out Meredith has been exposed to rabies. Which is like 10 times worse than a little crack in your pelvis. Thanks to me she went to the hospital and I saved her life. Curse is broken. Curse is broken people!  Oh... there is a God, and he has a plan for us after all. So go home get some rest, very very good work today. We got a lot accomplished.
I know a lot of you are upset with me for endangering Meredith's life by hitting her, with my car. But it may make you feel a little better to know that before that happened, Dwight endangered her life, by putting a garbage bag over her head that had a bat in it.
This place is so cursed.
I was in the hospital room with her. How contagious is that, is that like an STD?
Oh God, Rabies?
Well, you're going to have to run, or you're going to be in a lot of trouble. It is not olden times anymore.
OK, well back in olden times, a large fat person, like this, was a person of power. A person who had money, could buy food, person of respect. Like the regional manager of the day. Whereas, someone athletic and trim, like myself, was someone who worked in the fields... And I was a peasant.
I know that you're probably scared of people seeing your fat legs in shorts.
Oh, look at that, 3. Way to honor Meredith, Phyllis.
That... is for a good cause. Phyllis, how's the rabies quilt coming?
Come on man, gotta step it up! It's for a good cause. Jan called this morning and pledged $500.00.
Hi Stanley, how many sponsors so far?
Have you met that kid? He's not going to college.
That's possible. Look into that.
What about a rabies nurse?
You didn't contribute very much. I was also hoping to hand the giant check to a rabies doctor. And how's that been going?
Hmm... That's a tough decision. Um... I always imagined it with a giant check. So...
No I didn't, just please don't...
What are you doing?
Hey, hey, h
That's not gross, it is the human body. What is your problem? Pam you're an artist, right? Think of me as one of your models. OK, you know what, I don't want this to detract from what we really need to be thinking about today, it's not fair to people with rabies. And that's the point, right? OK, let's go have some fun.
Besides my shirt tail covered most of it so...
European offices are naked all the time.
Yes, but I have an office, so why would I do that.
See how I did that. That's the way you should enter a room. You knock and then you wait for the all clear.
May I enter the room?
Right? Wow, very cool you went back and got your degree. I would like you to accept this check, for $340.00 made out to science. Make sure that, that gets into the right hands.
Oh hey, I know you... Elizabeth?
He's happy because he's insane. You know what, that's the perfect example of the kind of awareness we need to generate. Where's the nurse?  This is the reason we're here.
No, don't give him... just, did you hear anything I said?
OK everybody, listen up. Thank you for coming. Before we get started I wanted to say a few words about this deadly disease called rabies. And I'd like you to take a look into the face of rabies.  That should scare you. It scares me. You people need to educate yourselves. M
OK, fettuccine alfredo, time to carbo-load.
I am fast! I'm very fast! I'm like Forrest Gump, except I am not an idiot.
No, no water for me. Not while rabies causes fear of water... solidarity!
Excellent! ...Simpsons. Wait, Imodium or Ex-lax?
Take bat bites seriously. Don't get bit.
You don't, you don't know me. You've just seen my penis. I can make a difference, remember, I'm the one who started this whole thing off by hitting Meredith with my car. And I owe it to her to finish this... GD 5k  No, no!
You just don't think I am capable, of making a difference.
Pam, if everybody felt that way, nothing would get done.
That's a good deal.
No, There are people all over the world, who have all sorts of problems and afflictions, and diseases. They're deformed, and they're abnormal, and... they're illiterate and ugly. Symphonies don't have any money. Public TV is bust. I can't do anything about it, I can't... you know. There's just one of me, and there's a thousand of them. And rabies wins.
What do you want me to do Jim?
I can't finish. I feel so weak, I just...
I'm not really sick.  Nah, I'm good.
Thanks, I'm not mad at you anymore.  Wanna share?
It's ironic isn't it? I mean I'm in the hospital for not getting enough water, and you're in it for a disease that causes the fear of water.
Hey Mer. How ya doing?
That's not what...no, no, I'm not saying that, that's disgusting.
I am saying... that... maybe I was drunk.  Did you ever think of that?
I'm not going to leave until you forgive me.
Let's just... Why can't you just forgive... Why, why are you having such a hard time laughing this off?  How do you know that you weren't born with some sort of abnormal pelvis that it was just bound to crack at some point?
You know what, why don't go around the room and say one memory of Meredith.  I'll start.  I liked her jumpers.  They reminded me of Kindergarten.  Jim?
Maybe the conference room, maybe the annex.  I'm just saying, at least right here  is cursed.  Conference room, 10 minutes.
Yes.  It is a philosophy which says people can improve their lives by using reason instead of religion or superstition.
Oh.  Great.  We have a secular humanist here, that is disgusting.
Oscar, are you Santaria?
That was the curse, Stanley, and we are trying to find the cause of the curse.
We have to have done something wrong.
Oh, all right!  All right!  All right!  All right!
Come on, I'm going backwards.
No, no, no Pam let 'em ring. Let the bells of Dunder Mifflin chime out your love. Because this is  really good, this is really good. My heart soars with the eagles nest.
I love you guys, so much.
Oh kay, mind is exploding. Get over here.  Everyone, this is a day that will live in infamy. Because today, is the day that Jim and Pam become one.
You guys! Yes! Yes!
Is this about me and Jan? In my office? Because I will have you know that that was consensual. What we did has nothing to do with you or anyone here. I don't think. I don't think anyone heard anything. We were very discreet and, and most people had left by that point. So I don't think it's any of your business. What I think you should do is roll up the memo, real tight...
I just want to remind everyone about the company rules involving PDA or public displays of affection.
Blowing up balloons I thought.
Sounds good. OK, alright.
Yes, everybody, come on. Settle town. Let's get serious here. Um Ryan, has a very special, important presentation to do, which we will be doing in the conference room in  10 minutes?
Woooo! I think Ryan has a gay crush on me.
That's a little kinky. I don't swing that way.
Fire guy. Don't start any fires, Ryan.
That's right! That's right!
...business meeting --
Ohh, yeah, let's get started because uh, yes, cause uh this is very serious business and umm..
There he is! There he is! He's back! And he's with a beard.  He... He has facial hair. Look at him! All grown up and no place to go. Hello, Mr. Sunny Crockett. I'm Tubs.
Ryan Howard everybody.
OOhh. Gimmme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
I am not old. You are old. You are like a hundred.
Good, so, we're on the same page?
Yeah, I know I understand... we're making great strides and we're updating, but business as usual, no?
Yeah, kay. I was just... After the presentation, just wanted to make sure, that vis-a-vie, that everything in the office is business as usual?
So older people have just as many rights as younger people?
What is that... word?
Oh, I dunno, they're launching a big new business plan. New website, blah blah blah. He's being a real twerp about it, so, it's all about youth, and agility and streamlining and trying to squeeze out the older people.
I don't want to grow weird sperm in case we ever want to have kids.
I was going to put up some new pictures, but umm, all of the ink in the printer was gone.
No, Creed, no they are not. In fact, many cultures revere old people because of their storytelling ability. Like the old lady from Titanic.  Yeah.
Hey, shut up Toby. Look, why do we as a society hate old people so much?
Still my office, Ryan.  Well, there has been a lot of talk about new ideas today. Well, new ideas are fine, but they are also... illegal, because they are a form of ageism. What? Yes, I am right. Did you know that the Age Discrimination and Employment Act of 1967 prohibits employment discrimination based on age with respect to employees 40 years of age or older? I did.
Have a seat. Like everybody else.
Have a seat.
Good, we're all here, we can get started.
Fine. Then I will call David Wallace and you can explain to him why you threw the founder of the company out on his ancient butt.
Ah, still sends his own proxy. Good for you.
Eighty-seven years young. And still active. That is great. Did you know, that Bob is still a member of the Board of Dunder Mifflin?Robert D
No, No. Don't help him. He doesn't need help, Pam.  What a nice guy.
Inspirational. What have we learned?  Well, we have learned that you can't teach an old dog new tricks, because it's illegal, and you will go to jail.
Perfect. Robert D
That's great. Thank you for coming in.  Thank you. That was wonderful. Do you have a ride?Robert D
Great.  Robert D
Oh, boy.Robert D
I happen to think the old ways of doing business are better. And I can prove it.
I disagree, I think it was very valuable.
Yes, no! No, those are for our clients. Actually, our exclients. I'll explain, later.
No, Dwight. That smells like good business to me. What I have done here is I have collected all the finest gourmet items that Scranton has to offer.
With peanut brittle, with macadamia nut cookies, with chocolate turtles, with raspberry jam and a little bit of fat and salt because you know what? That's what people like.
I am glad that you asked, listen up everybody. In the last year, we have lost seven clients to the big chains. These gift baskets are our ticket back into their lives. We are going to show up at these businesses unannounced, and we are going to win them back.
But thank you, that was really nice of you to say.
We don't need luck.
Fine. Then God speed. To both of us.
No, this is my quest.
Fine, I'm just going to go by myself, and I am going to win them back by myself because this is important to me.
Gift baskets are amazing, Phyllis. Gift baskets are... the essence of class and fanciness. They are the ultimate present that a person can recieve.
OK, that's not helpful Phyllis.
Why don't we just go as teams to demonstrate our teamsmanship?
I know. So who's next?
It is in the body shop. Had to have the dent taken out of the hood where I hit Meredith.
Well just, uh enjoy the gift basket.Larry M
OK, you know what? Just enjoy the gift basket and remember that we provide a personal touch.
Yes we do.Larry M
How do they know? How does this know where to turn? That's very impressive.
Yes, she is nuts.
That is true.
OK, good. Don't let Emily have any of the cajun almonds, she's alergic.
Great, the magic of the gift basket.Ex-
Look... we're also coming out with a website soon. It's a state of the art thing, it'll be up and running, it's gonna cut costs and it will make ordering much much easier.Ex-
Why would he come back? I will tell you, Dwight. He would come back because we offer a wide selection of products and because you're definitely not getting the same sort of customer service that you get with us.
No it's not.Ex-
Look, we want you back.Ex-
Ah... .is that all you have to say?Ex-
OK, OK! So you'll reconsider?Ex-
She's gonna be like eleven this winter? Wow, they grow up so fast. I have a few of my own that I want some day. Listen, I don't want to take any more of your time, I know you're a very busy man. The reason we have stopped by is to drop you off this elaborate bag of goodies, and to ask you to reconsider.Ex-
Ah, well it's still very good. I bet I know someone who hasn't heard that joke... your daughter Emily. How's she doing?Ex-
Let go, let go of me!
The machine knows--- stop yelling at me!
The machine knows where it is going!
Maybe it's a shortcut Dwight. It said go to the right.
No, it said right, it said take a right.
That is a very good point, Dwight.
I don't get it, I really don't get it. I thought this would work. I do everything I had at that guy and nothing.
Good, that is what's most important.
We're gonna take what's rightfully ours! We're gonna take a stand, Dwight! We're gonna take a stand!
Hang up.  You know what we're gonna do? We're walking back. We're walking back to that office and we're gonna reclaim our gift basket!
What about that last guy, Aaron? Is he a jerk. "I don't even know if I want it. They're website is so easy". Yeah, well, you can have your technology jackass, look where it got us.
These people just don't realize what a gift basket means, they don't get it.
WHERE ARE THE TURTLES? WHERE ARE THEY?
What's missing... the turtles. Where are the turtles? Where are the turtles?Ex-
It's been opened.Ex-
Look, my clothes are so wet!
Give it back. The gift basket, give it back.Ex-
Maybe, maybe not, time will tell. But I will tell you one thing. Those gift baskets never endangered anybody's lives.  Game set match... point... Scott... game over... end of game.
I drove my car into a  lake. Why you may ask did I do this? Well, because of a machine. A machine told me to drive into a lake. And I did it! I did it because I trusted Ryan's precious technology, and look where it got me.
Ryan thinks that technology is the answer. Well guess what? I just drove my car into a lake.
Um... yes, I'll be right back!
You don't want me to help?
I know, I know, no, what... something else.
No, I skipped through all of the boring stuff and went right to his joke page.  Which proves that he was old, but he was also hilarious.
And still rockin', Oscar.  One of the greatest all-time oldies was a little Oriental guy named Confucius.  He literally invented the ancient Chinese secret.  Here's some of his quotes.  Confucius say, "Man who farts in church must sit in his own pew."  Confucius say, "Man with hand in pocket feel cocky all day."  Confucius also say, "Virgin like balloon.  One prick, all gone!"
I'm not.  It's solitaire.  See?
I'm a little busy right now.  Could you BlackBerry me a message?
That was awesome. Thank you.
Alright. Alright.  Let's quit while we're ahead.
Like, something that you have to look for.  Sort of a "Where's Waldo."
Maybe, we could have some sort of riddle?
Yeah!  I know.  I know.  It's bland.
And... today the Dunder-Mifflin Infinity website officially launches.
Mmmmmm.  Okay.  Attention.  Earthlings.  I have some news.  Beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep beep, beep beep beep beep.  Okay.  Today is the big day that I am heading to New York to attend a party with sushi and important people.  On an unrelated note, if anyone has an interesting anectdote that is not boring and easy to memorize please drop by my office before I leave.  Thank you.
Oh, does he?
What's that, pipsqueak?
No.  It doesn't.  I'll find out tonight.
Okay, wow!  Easy, booster seat, nobody cares about this party anyway.
Ohh, lunch party.
I had um, one of those danishes.
Oh good.  Okay cool.  How many pounds do you think I could lose by 7?
Umm... hey.  Ah, what's hanging?Tech G
It's the European cut.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.  It's just the first... girl that popped into my head.  I'll find somebody I haven't slept with.
Na... no.  No.  If I go by myself everybody will think I'm a big loser.  J
Just let me know who the winner is.Pam and J
Alright.  Well fight it out amongst yourselves.  I was thinking Pammy but boys night out is also good.
If you are not this tall, you may not ride the rollercoaster.  See you guys tomorrow.
Oh yeah, you'd better.  You better say good-bye to Pam.  Say good-bye to Pam.  Byyyyyye.  I love you.    I'm leavin' inside Jim's car, I don't know when I'll be back again.  Yes I do.  Tomorrow I'll be back.  I'll be back.  Tomorrow.  Um... yeah.  So you know what?  Why don't you guys take off a little bit early tonight?
Yes.  Thank you.
No, I'm sure that's not.  Na... J
Yes.  Actually I will tell you right now.  It's a club called Chatroom, and there's a password to get in, which is actually password.  So... J
After work you guys... J
Wanna come over Friday?
You guys should come over for dinner.  You and Pam.  That'd be fun.  Friday?
One for me one for Jan.
Same sort of stuff in here.  J
Got it for Ryan.  Wanted to get him Oh The Places You'll Go, but they were sold out.  Figured... J
Yeah.  I withdrew too.
Oh hey!  Good for you.  Good for you.  Scranton power.  Alright you know what?  Angela I'd like you to come into my office in ten minutes. Bring something to write with and something to write on.  Good.
Nope nope nope no.  This is going to be nothing like the party you've been planning.  This is going to be good and everybody's gonna come.  What's wrong with Dwight?
I think I faked Stanley out too.  Who else thought that I was leaving?  And they could all go home early?  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Gotcha.  Well who needs New York?  Right?  We can have a killer party right here in Scranton.
Ohhh, what?  Oh I think I faked Oscar out.
No seriously.  Is there anyone else who could do it better?  Because we don't have a lot of time.  I'll get the pizza!
Yes you can.  I know you can.  I wouldn't say that if I didn't hundred percent believe it.  Who else could do this?
Yes you can.
I want it to embarrass all other parties.  I want it to be a party that the guys in New York watch on the web-cam and say, "Wow! How did they get Al Roker to come?"
I would like this party to be sexier, cooler, more important... A
Those are just things.  This is how I want it to feel. A
Good.  These are some things that I would like to have happen.
Okay, okay, what's better?  A medium amount of good pizza?  Or all you can eat of pretty good pizza?
Pizza by Alfredo.
You know what?  I don't understand when you all talk at the same time.
Guess who just ordered from your favorite pizza place, Alfredo?
No, you don't even know what stupid is.  It's about to get all stupid up in here.
Yes you are, yes you are, and you will come out when you decide to give me a discount on the pizza.  Please, thank you.Pizza g
You know what?  This young man needs to learn that's not how you treat people.  I don't care if it's pizza.  Good business is about respect and accountability and follow through.  You don't just make promises and pull the rug out from under somebody, do you?  Dwight, please escort this young man into the conference room.  Right now, get in the conference room.Pizza g
No, no you're not going anywhere.  You're staying here until we figure this out.Pizza g
I'm not giving that to you.Pizza g
It is your problem.  That's no way to do business, okay? I ordered eight pizzas with a half-off coupon, so I would like eight pizzas for half-off.  End of story.Pizza g
What do you mean hmm-um?Pizza g
Okay, it doesn't say it anywhere on the coupon, and if it's policy, it should say it on the coupon.Pizza g
You didn't actually think I was going to spend sixty bucks on pizza?
Yeah, I told them on the phone that I was ordering eight pizzas.Pizza g
Right, I have a coupon, so half of sixty-three fifty, and half the tip of sixty-three fifty.Pizza g
You don't have to say it like that.
Alright stop, stop making him say it!  You just made this worse, a whole lot worse.
Yeah sales, you sell pizza.  Last time I checked that's called sales.Pizza g
No!  I'm an adult, I don't have to think or do anything.  You're a kid, a little snot-nosed, punk kid who thinks he's better than everyone else, because he's some hot shot, and you don't know anything about sales.  So stop being a disrespectful little jerk, okay?Pizza g
Alright, Dwight, knock it off.  You better think about what you are doing young man.Pizza g
Okay, what have you been doing in here this whole time?Pizza g
He said no.
Trouble.  Okay, alright.
Yes, is Alfredo there?  Can I speak to a manager then?  Okay, can you tell the manager that I'm keeping his delivery kid until I get a discount on the eight pizzas I ordered.  Yes, I know it is not on the coupon.  Also I would like him to throw in two, three pizzas for our...
I think you're over-thinking it.
I'm not kidnapping him, I'm keeping him until I get what I want.
You know what Jim, the world would be a better place if people were held accountable for their actions.
Let go of the little jerk boy before he has learned his lesson?
Mister Overdramatic, what's up Kevin?
I'll just wave and introduce myself.
Hey, I just think you should know that one of my salesmen beat your stupid computer, so take that hole.
Oh my God, oh my God.
I could have paid for the pizza.
Hey, hey, hey stop it.  Stop it now, God. Oh my God, oh my God, no, no, no.  I kidnapped a kid.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
Not now Dwight, please, it's not the time.
Now we wait, and hopefully nothing happens.
See ya, drive safely.
And hopefully he will walk out, and the rest is out of our hands.
I will open the door.
Mmm-kay.  I want you to go in there, and pay him for the pizzas, and give him a generous tip, no more than ten percent.
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
Alright, you drive.
New York.  Wanna go?
Uh-uh, no, there is only one place where they authentic New York style sushi.
I'm going to get it.
Well, I need to get the horrible taste of this pizza out of my mouth.  I'd really like some sushi.  I was hoping that I would have New York style sushi today.  And you know what?
Wanna head back?
Well, it's part of it, it's just the... uhhh.
And I'm hot, I'm so hot. That's why everybody...
I started a fire, I started a fire.
I made it with my cheese pita.
I never sold any paper, because I'm an idiot.
I'm Ryan, and tonight didn't go the way that I thought it would, because it didn't work out for me, and I'm very embarrassed.  I got egg all over my face.
Oh, thanks.  This is the guy that beat the computer.
Hey, you know what?  Come on, come on, let's go.
Here we go.
All right!  Martha Stewart!  You can be Martha Stewart's receptionist!  Very good!  I will be tea baggin' it.  Nn... no.
The big, free mirrors that the city puts up, on trees and telephone poles?  The big round things.
What, no.  No.  Okay, bags.  I have bags under my eyes, Pam.  I didn't see it at home, I didn't see it in the bathroom, I didn't see it on any of the city mirrors, but in this light...
I want you to look at me and tell me what is wrong with me.   Don't avoid this.  I know you're dying to say it, so just say it.
Where's Armani? He's on the phone. Too slow. You are not going to Paris. I'm so much better than you are.
On the phone.
Meryl Streep is the bad guy. Never see it coming. Anyways, if I was mean in any way to you, I am sorry. I just want what's best for you, Mo Chuisle.
Yeah. It was awesome. Big surprise ending. Won't ruin it for you.
I--- Ok. How much is this going to cost?
It... folds up. You've only seen it flat.
We already have a sofa. So why do---
I haven't heard the same about you. So let's just go with mine.
Wait, oh, no, here it is, here it is. Found it.
Okay, yeah, I dunno. I dunno, I think those IT guys messed up.
Yes, and thank you for sending that to me.
Oh! Um, actually, I need the car.
You wouldn't understand. It's a secret.
Dammit to hell. I-I-ugh, ok. All right.
How about this weekend?
Oh no, I have a thing tonight.
You can not, I have a thing tonight.
No, they're with me, so... this is Nick Figaro, manager to the stars!
Hey, I just got off the phone, and I was gonna make another call. N
These meetings are useless.
Or a trained seal.
Have you--- Have you considered satellite television?
Senor, are you happy with your---
I'm just calling because you responded positively to the---
Well, I hope this conversation has helped.
Vikram doesn't have my people skills. N
It is not a waste of our time.
Look, I know sales, and I had that sale, I just needed a few more minutes---
I am going with the vanilla crisp this evening.
Oh, that looks good.
I would've been chief of surgery... Or a cowboy.
I know, but it's competitive here. What's a dollar worth in your land? Medical school must cost like 40 bucks or a donkey or something.
Wonder what I would've been back home?
Um, sort of a spy, thriller...
I'm writing one, yeah.Co-Worker 3: What's it about?
I actually wrote a movie. Co-Worker 3: Really?
I'm gonna have it one of these nights.
Hey, congrats on the bonus.
Good night Vikram.
Okay. How's yoga?
Okay, see you guys.  Hey, how you doin'?
Thanks, no, I have work tomorrow morning.Co-Worker 2:  All right, next time dude.
Ahh, still lame. Okay. All right. Thank you, Ryan, for that wonderful introduction. Okay, um, today we're gonna be talking... about...PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint! PowerPoint!
Um... that wasn't much of an introduction.
No one, uh, asked you anything ever, so whomever's name is Toby, why don't you take a letter opener and stick it into your skull.
Well it sounds right, but is it?
Not a native speaker.
No, whomever is never actually right.
It's whoever, not whomever.
Why don't you do the presentation, because you know how to do it?
Okay, honestly, it was unlikely I was gonna figure this out anyways.
What I do between 5:30 pm and 1 am is no one's business but mine and my other business'.
My other boss, Mr. Figaro.
No, I had a really rough night, and my boss can back you up on that.
I am.Mr. F
In this dream I did both of these jobs beautifully, and I loved it, and everybody loved me.  But the truth is, I can't do this.Mr. F
Okay, um, Oscar, I'm going to need to take another advance on my salary.
Do you know anybody in the mob?
Yeah, I was thinking about doing some gambling myself.  You know, just a little bit of money.  Maybe doubling it, and them doubling it seven more times.  I don't know, kind of just for fun.  I was thinking, do you have tips, or ideas about sure things.  Like a boxer who is going to throw the big fight, you know, like, like he's tied into some crooked dealings, maybe his kid is sick or something.  Like, who do I call about that?
Yeah, but I destroyed it, it's not even useable anymore.
I totally agree with you.  But I don't have money problems, I don't.  Alright, you know what?  Watch this, if I had money problems, would I do this? Oscar and S
I don't talk to my girlfriend about money.  It is rude, and unsexual.
I don't have a second job.  Maybe I'm having an affair with Suzanne Summers.
Oh, I hate monkeys.
Monkey problem? No, I'm not having monkey problems.  Why would I have monkey problems?
Hey, hey, hey.
What'cha talking about?    Okay, I know what's going on.  You're talking about Jim and Pam, if they're having sex, what it looks like, I know, I think---
No you didn't.
Like the witness protection program.
That is a good point.
I didn't say it, I declared it.
That is by far the best way to strengthen your core.  This machine, you sit on a stabilizer ball, you put your feet into the power stir-ups, you reach up and you grab onto the super rod, and you twist, and you twist, and you twist.  It strengthens your entire core.  Your back core, your arm core, the Marine Core actually uses it.  I think that's how they got a core.
Oh, that's the Muppet Show, on DVD, classic.
You know, Jan has my credit cards, and she's using them as if I'm made of money, she thinks I'm a human ATM machine.
Yeah, tell me about it.
How do they do this so fast?  Is this power-point?
Mm-hm.  That is so cool how you have my name at the top.
No you're not! Ok, just... you're not a tool. Look, we'll tell her that it's bad, but it could've been a lot worse but due to some fancy financial foot work I was able to cut it in half. O
You're a presentation tool if you think I'm gonna tell Jan about this.
We will find another way, we'll ask power-point.
No, no, we are going to leave Jan out of this.
Um, that's, how did you get that from what Oscar's saying?
I think the engineer left.
That's really nice of you to say.
Yeah it is, it is.  I really messed up.
I'll stay off the grid.
I don't know that.
I told you, no more answers.  This is who I am now.  A guy on a train with no answers.  I hope that can be enough for you.
I'm out of answers Jan.
Not much, what's up with you?
It looks cute though.
That's nice though.
All right, well, go find some.  Get outa here, please.
What is the matter with you?
Were you listening to what I was saying?
What do you mean, "what"?
Do you think I'll get any new ones?  I could...
And, um the Case Logic portfolio is currently in the back seat of my car.  There is another smaller Case Logic portfolio clipped to my visor   What?
My CDs are in a portfolio, a rather large portfolio, um, called Case L
Um, my CDs.
Yeah, I will.
Well, please?  I won't tell anybody.  J
Okay.  What?  Um...
I don't know if I can do that.  I can't see myself spending the next six years digging myself out of that kind of hole.
I can't go back to that.
Dancing babies! I love it! I love it!
Look at that. Even the receptionist is getting in on the creativity. Very good, very good.
Okay, it's football cream. It's football cream. Alright! So, anybody else?
You know, I want this to be cutting edge. I want it to be fast, quick cuts, you know, youthful, sort of a MTV on crack kind of thing.Ad guy 1: That sounds great.
Regional manager.Ad guy 2: Hey Michael, nice to meet y
Michael Scott.Ad guy 2: Hey, Michael.
Stanley is hilarious. Phyllis is like our Mrs. Butterworth. Kind of a less urban Aunt Jemima. M
Now this gentleman right here is the key to our urban vibe.
I would like you to meet Andrew Bernard. The 'Nard Dog. Who let the 'Nard Dog out? A
The waving? Ad guy 1: Well, no, no. You don't have to be waving. That was just what they did. You guys can be clapping. Sitting. Standing outside, inside, whatever. This is where you really get to be creative.
Well we can do better than that.Ad guy 2: Well the main part of the ad has to stay the same, actually.Ad guy 1: Yeah, it's the last five seconds where we have some leeway.
That's what Nassau came up with? That sucks!  Whoa.Ad guy 1: That's what we came up with.
Yeah, I know.Ad guy 1: Why don't we show you what we did with the Nashua branch?
Actually I don't get paid by the hour anymore, but thank you, I get paid by the year, so...Ad guy 1: That all sounds really, really ambitious.
Are you? I don't think you're doing such a good job here, suppressing ideas and creativity.
Well actually I can't cook, and I am starting a restaurant. Mike's Cereal Shack. I'm thinking we'll have as many varieties as you can buy in the store.
Yeah, well when I call about big problems you don't like that either, so make up you mind, kiddo. Here is the deal, the ad guys that you sent are locking me in a creative box, and sort of ignoring my ideas.
Okay, calm down. I have a small problem. R
I'm just kidding. It's me. Hello Ry. R
How about never hundred hours, sir.Ad guy 2: We were sent here to help out.Ad guy 1: Okay I'm not going to argue with this guy. Let's go. Good luck dude. M
I'm willing to stake my entire reputation on it.David W
Yeah, I'm glad you called. Ryan is being a little bitch again.
Well they're wrong. You are creative. You are damn creative. Each and every one of you. You are so much more creative than all of the other dry, boring morons that you work with. J
Okay, okay, Phyllis this is what I want you to do. I want you to go down to the mall. I want you to get in line. I want you to get her to be in this commercial. This would be a huge coupe people. All right? Do not take no for an answer.
Line it up Phyllis.
Okay, Darryl, wow, you need to learn a lot about your own culture. I'll make you a mix. D
Time out, time out, time out, time out, time out. I thought... I was under the impression that this was going to be a rap.
Okay, you know what. Hold on, hold on Darryl.
No, I hate it! I hate it! ...I don't hate it, I just don't like it at all. And it's terrible. D
Stop. Stop stop stop stop stop stop. This is not me. This is not my music.
Ugh, can somebody give her a tissue please?
Andy, Andy, this is a pivotal scene in the ad. And if we don't get this, if we don't nail it, we're going to lose the whole triumph of the moment. The triumph of the will. Now, God, what? What Phyllis?
Okay, wow. Wow, this looks uh, terrible.
Pam, please clear my phone lines.
No, it was stupid. People like waving, waving sells. It's not art. Yet we made our ad, the real one was full of humor, and full of depth, and full heart and it was real.
That was fun. Next round of drinks is on me, people!
Okay, good. Good.
Cool. Cool, I just wanted to make sure you got it.
About dressing your best today?
And that is probably why most ads suck.  Pam! Pam, come here for a second. Did you get the memo about dressing your best?
There are no bad ideas but for an idea, that was really, really bad.
And anybody else, we can just hire an actor to replace.  Follow me!  Let's get this movin'.
That's, that's a pirate movie.
No, that's skeptical. Do sad.
So do, um, do sad, do the sad face. J
And if not we can just make him disappear.  This is Jim! Halpert. Jim has a very expressive face, don't you Jim? He is like our Mr. Bean.
Do you want this open or closed?
I can do it good.  I can do it good.  Please, don't.  Please.   Please give me it.
No!  No!  Jim, Jim, don't, don't... J
If you don't let me pursue my artistic vision, I am going to walk!
This is bull!
Okay, we widen to reveal a spaceship blasting out of a woman's womb.  J
We start on a single blank sheet of paper.
...and we need to be done by 9 A.M. tomorrow.
Now, we have eighty-five dollars, and a Sam Goody gift certificate...
You are my producer, you are a suit.  I am the creative genius.  You take care of all the boring stuff, and let my mind just run free.
Actually, I'm a little concerned about having a black person do the music, because that could create a positive stereotype that could then become a... celestine prophesy, and keep the next Bon Jovi from ever picking up a piano.
Okay, okay.  Who could do music?
I can't hear you!   Heard you a little bit less that time.  Must be...
Just go out, and come back in.
Well, sometimes.  Most of the time I will be with Ryan, or Darryl.    Yes?  Oh good, good Stanley!  First victim, this is what I want you to do.  Go out, come back in.  We're going to hide.  I want you to tell me if this looks like me, okay?
But, you will not tell anyone.
This is a dummy, a la Ferris Bueller's Day Off.  We have tied a string to the wrist, which goes to the door.  When somebody opens the door, the hand goes down, hits the remote, turns on the tape recorder, which is me snoring.  Now nobody knows whether I am here, or whether I am gone.
That could not possibly be it.
Okay, smarty pants, then why?  Why is she trying to take Stanley from us?
No, no, no, no, no-no, no no.  You completely misinterpreted my tone, this is a horrible thing.  Clearly, Karen is trying to get back at us because Jim dumped her.
Mo money mo problems, Stanley.  You of all people should know that.  Let me ask you this, if I were-
Yeah we all want money.  But there is none in the budget, so... Tell me why you're really leaving.
Okay, good-bye.  Wait!  Wait! Karen, could you transfer me to one of your salespeople please?  Your best one?
You can train him.  He's very very smart, and funny, and charming... You know, I can't do it, Toby is the worst.  That- that was a bluff, um...  Listen, if you are going to poach one of my guys, I'm going to poach one of yours.
No, his work family.  Look, this is very hard for me, but I'm going to give you my best man.  You may have Toby.
Yes, listen, um...  You cannot tear Stanley from his family like this.
Okay, enough small talk, go ahead.
To the right?
Fillipellers, how's it hanging?  K
No, I fired them, and your next. ... So what do you say?
Uh, yeah.  I also saved her life, but I guess that's not as grabby.
I'm going to cut right to the chase here.  Do you like magic?  Because I'm a genie in a bottle, and I'm going to grant you three wishes.  To move to Scranton, to have a great job, and to be my best friend.
Hi Ben, Michael Scott.
That's the problem, that's the problem.  We need rock n' roll Pam, rock n' roll.  Alright?  Oh... My... God, that's why people are leaving.  I- I have no words.
Yes they did, oh yes they did, and we are going to murder it.  You, me, Dwight are going to jump into my PT Cruiser, and we're going to crush this sale.  We're going to prove, what the hell is that music?
What are we going to do?  We are going to make a monster sale, that's what we're going to do.  Corcroan dropped Staples.
Jim, we're getting crapped on.  Word is that our branch sucks, and we have to do something about it.
We are going to make Karen wish that she had never been dumped by you.Michael and D
Yes you are.  Oh, buckle up Jim.
We are going on a panty raid to Utica, is what we're doing.
What are we doing, Dwight, what we are doing?
Look at his face! Look at his face!
What? What? We did?Dwight and M
It had to be done, it had to be done.
Yep, get it.
Are you calling Karen?
In your f
Teach her to offer Stanley more money.
It could be badass.  Yeah, it will.
Uh, maybe, maybe, I don't know.
No, no, not real bombs.
Follow me, come here.  Here's what we brought, we brought uniforms from the warehouse.  I brought silly string, Dwight brought gasoline and chunks of rubber to make stink bombs.
Do you really wanna know?
Alright, you're going to miss the best prank ever.
Hey Dwight, he found it.
That is just so disgusting!
I'll kill you man!
Come on man, that is disgusting Dwight!
What is that?  Dwight, are you peeing?
Ah, la, la, la. What is that?  That sound...  The air-conditioning leaking or something?
I'm trying to think of what we could sell.
Okay, I will start.  Um, "A."  "A" my name is Alan, and my wife's name is Alice, we live in Alaska, and we sell...  Damn it! What do we sell?  Um...
I can't imagine the sex being bad, I mean her body is...
You and I are going to sneak inside and pretend that we are warehouse workers.  And then we will silly string the beejeezus out of the place.
Yeah, Dwight, here's how it's going to go down.  You and I-
Afro wig, do you want the afro wig?
Oh my God, oh my God, that was very close.
There's a guy, there's a guy.
It doesn't have to mean anything.  Just, do it for Stanley.  Come on Jim, just climb on top of her and think about Stanley.  Ah, Jim, if this is it for me, promise me something, host the Dundies.
Just say you wanna get back together.
Take her to a motel, make love to her Jim.
Dwight, could you move over a little bit.
Dwight, you gotta move!
We're wedged between the copier and the railing. Ah! Ow! Ow, my leg!  Jim leave us.
It's enormous, but it's got wheels.  We're wheeling it down the hall, into the stairwell.  Get the car ready, keep the engine running.
We found something far better, their crown jewel.  Their industrial copier.
I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  Dwight, you're handsome.  You're a very handsome man, get in the car. D
Yes, I am, but I want shotgun for you.
Dwight!  Stop it!    Can you help me please, I'm being crushed.
Hey, nobody cares. Nobody cares. I need that room at some point, so just, wrap it up.
So if I were to hypothetically ask you to go camping with me, would you go? J
Oh, you wanna go today?
I'm sick of it Jim. I'm sick of this place.
I wanna do it myself. You know, I want to go and, and find out something about myself, I wanna get outta here. All the cliques, and the office politics. Fluorescent lights. Asbestos.
In the wilderness. It's not with a group of guys frolicking around in tents. It's one guy, or two guys, if your plans change.
Hello, I'm Broken Mountain. You know, here's the thing. That's not how you go camping. I think you go camping by yourself---
A bunch of guys, in a tent? Making s'mores?
Yeah, just this whole Toby, camping thing, uh, seems a little lame. J
Your body only has a certain amount. J
Hey, hey hey! Dwight. . Dwight.
OK. Thirty minutes or less, please come back. Save the receipts.  Hey, what... D
When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.
This is a very personal, private experience in the wild, that I wish to share it with me, myself and I. J
Where he will then leave me to either die or to survive. The choice is yours. J
Dwight will be driving me deep into the Pennsylvania wilderness.
Just, please allow me to have one cathartic experience in my life?
No! Gosh! Dwight.  Stop it, stop it! Stop it.
You... you are as creepy as a real serial killer. For real.  OK.
Well, yes I would. And I would survive. D
Dwight will take my blindfold off when we are deep in the forest. Just the two of us from this point out. D
Thanks for the ride. OK. Leave me be, Dwight.
What are you doing? Stop. Dwight, Dwight. Just --
Hey! Nice. Really good. Bravo, my young ward.
I never know. I just say it. I say stuff like that, you know, to lighten the tension. When things sort of get hard.
That's what I said. That's what she said.
Uh huh. Yeah, just wait. Ten years, you'll figure it out.
Yeah, okay, I did that. Rookie mistake. J
What up? J
Hypothetically... would you go camping with me, if I were to ask you?  And bear in mind that I would never actually ask you to go camping.  That Jim is also a friend of mine, and I would rather die than make any sort of improper ovation toward you.
We have been friends forever, right?
Pam, are you my friend?
Can you send Dwight in here?
Split the difference.  Hey... mint chocolate chip, please?  Is Jim out there?
Thank you for your honesty.
So, as friends, would you go with me on a camping trip?  P
What is this called again?
I'm telling you, all I will need are my instincts and my will to survive.
MmMmm.  All I need...
No, just get me a case.   All right.
All right, Dexter, just give me the knife. D
I'll call back.
You can't always work 200 days though.
I refuse. My house, my rules, I insist.
N-No, money isn't everything Ryan. And you're my friend, and I don't want to be rude.
Oh. Ah, this is a very important client. But, I have the most important client sitting right in front of me, my boss, so I will call him later.
I'm getting car sick! Ugh, I'm gonna puke. I think I'm gonna throw up.
Four million dollars! Man that is a lot of guacamole. A lot of the green. Lot of green. That is why I have memorized Jan's answers, and I have also thrown in some errs, and ahhs, to make it seem like it's not memorized.
So, here's the deal. Um, I am on my way to New York to be deposed as part of Jan's wrongful termination law suit. The company fired her for having the courage to augment her boobs.
Yeah, I hate that.
Hey hey. R
Yeah, a bunch of rich lawyers took the bus.  Where did you find this guy? Hey, there he is.
Abso-fruitley. Yeah. I'll-I'll do anything for the company. R
I would love that.
Okay. All right.
Never. I want him gone. I don't talk until he leaves.
Are you renewing your divorce vows, before my deposition?
Come again? That's what she said? I don't know what you're talking about.
Uh, wh-why would she say that?
That's what she said.
That's what she said.
Six years and two months. L
I haven't actually seen it. But I have seen the firm, and I am planning on renting The Pelican B
I will allow it.
Well, if it did, then the company is breaking its own rules.
Yes, and frankly, the timing was nothing short of predominant. L
I don't think anyone in this room has the right to read my diary.Diane K
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! What are you doing with my diary?
Fine. I love you.
I don't like lump. I'm really upset about this.
How'd you even find it?
"I am out of carrots. I am out of sticks. Mr. Scott has time and again proven himself to be an unmanageable employee, and a poor branch manager. I recommend he be removed from that position and re-assigned to sales where he belongs."Diane K
March 17th.Diane K
That was before our relationship. She was going through a divorce, and she was drinking a lot...  ...of water.Diane K
Thank you very much. You didn't have to say that.Diane K
Alright, alright. This is the way I see it. Yes, I had sex with Jan, and yes, I did consider Jan to be my girlfriend. However, Jan clearly didn't consider me to be her boyfriend. So her actions are completely rightful.Diane K
Not a woman, just a cool, great looking, best friend.
See? I was his number 1 contender. I was being groomed.
Dunder Mifflin has always treated me with the utmost respect, with loyalty. They were going to give me your job and I should have taken it.
I think you're a nice guy too.
Oh, hey no biggie. Just...David W
Do you fast food?
Sure trying to save some money... get something cheap.
Yes.  My testimony was actually very important, um, because the accident was my fault.  .
Forgot normal talk.
Can't stop.Diane K
Ye-ohh.  Ye-no.Diane K
Na, Na-oh, Naa-es.Diane K
.  All right.  Everybody feel better?Diane K
You said you didn't have plans. That's what you said.
I think we should celebrate. How about you, Pam, mi casa, a little dinner, dancing, drinks?
All right, happy Friday.  Well I think we dodged a bullet there.
Yes I remember. Mmm, this is B.S. This is B.S. Why are we here? I am going to call corporate. Enough is enough, I'm - God, I'm so mad!  Everybody I just got off the horn with corporate and basically I told them where they could stick their little overtime assignment. Go enjoy your Friday.
Nobody likes to work late, least of all me.  Do you have plans tonight?
Dwight, it's couples only. And besides, I only have six wine glasses, so it will be me and Jan, and Pam and Jim, and Angela and Andy.
Oh, just redoing the sliding glass door.
Totally your call babe.
Well have a seat, or come on in, or, I don't know, make yourself to home. This is our casa.
Well we have been doing pretty much the same thing.
Yes I would. So, what have you been doing?
Come on in. Good to see you.
It's actually a lot bigger than it seems. Look at this.
Thanks, that's my bed. Jan has some space issues, so I curl up on that puppy.
Guess what, white and eggshell white are exactly the same color.
James Bond Fire. I am Bond fire, James Bond Fire. Michael Scarn.
As you can smell there's a lot of different odors going on in here.
This is it, check that out, can you smell that?
Yep, never been used.
Whatever you say babe.
When in Rome.
I'll get it.
Oh honey, I have the best trophy right here, aside from my Dundies.
If you ever need any help, I am just a phone call away.
No, I think that is either pine, or nordic cherry.
Sometimes I will just stand here and watch television for hours. I love it, I love this TV. Oh and I also built this table.
You know what, Hunter was a terrible assistant, that is why Ryan fired him.
Yeah that sounds good.
Kinda sorta an oaky afterbirth.
Look at him, he's laughing.
And he was laughing.
Yes, I was watching Jim's face.
All right,  my my my my turn, my my my my turn, my my my my turn.
God, does anybody read the paper?!
Okay, he is the governor of California, he is the Terminator.
No! It has to be a real person Jim, come on. Okay, no no, I'm gonna pass, I'm gonna pass. Okay, rhymes with Parnold Schporzenegger.
No, Baah! But he's married to her!
All right, Okay, okay, you're getting inside my head. First name is blank and he goes on a cruise, he goes on a Caribbean CRUISE.
All right here we go, this is going to be fun, ready. All right first name is Tom-
That's true, that's a great point. Come on down here. Sit down on that couch and be amongst friends and we are not going to think about all your stuff being destroyed, all right.
Well you don't need two of you to do that.
Ha ha, you are! She is! She is the devil! I'm in hell! Aaahhh I'm burning, help me!
Stop, stop it! I mean, I like ice cream. Okay? Sue me. Oh, no, don't. I shouldn't say that jokingly because she will sue me. She loves to sue, loves lawsuits. You know honey, that door was extremely clean and it looked invisible.
I don't like that story babe.
I'm sorry.  What now?
Yeah, did you know that candles are the number one fastest-growing product in the scent aroma market? $2 billion dollar a year industry. And for only $10,000, you could become a co-owner of "Serenity by Jan" What do you think about that?
Do you mean it? You want to have a kid?
When I said that I wanted to have kids, and you said, you wanted me to have a vasectomy, what did I do? And then when you said that you might want to have kids and I wasn't so sure, Who had the vasectomy reversed? And then when you said you defintely didn't want to have kids, who had it reversed back? Snip snap! Snip snap! Snip snap! I did. You have no idea the physical toll, that three vasectomies have on a person. And I bought this condo to fill with children.
Whatever I want? It's never whatever I want. When I wanted to see Stomp, and you wanted to see Wicked, what did we see?
You said that I could not invite Dwight because he was not part of a couple, and because we didn't have enough wine glasses. Dwight brought glasses and a person.
Dwight is my friend.
I can't prove it but I think she might be trying to poison me.  Hey, looks great babe.
Pam... I hope she didn't do anything to the food.
You know what guys, she'll be out of the bathroom soon.
OH GOOD. I'LL BE YOUR FIRST CUSTOMER!
MAN! I WOULD LOVE TO BURN YOUR CANDLES!
NO ALL YOU DO IS YOU GET ME TO TRY TO WORK ON MY RICH FRIENDS!
BFD. I'm a screenwriter.
Jan thinks Hunter is very talented. You know what? I don't think he's that good.
No. No. I'm gonna leave it up. I think it ties the whole room together.
Everybody enjoying their meal?
Ok... alright... here we go.  Oooookay.
Excuse me for a second.
You know I have soft teeth, how can you say that?
I will take the fall. I did it.Officer 2: You know you don't have to press charges, you could just try to be more quiet.
Would she get into trouble?
Oh... yes. There was some screaming but... um... my girlfriend... threw a dundie at my TV. Plasma.Officer 1: You wanna press charges?
Nope. Nope. Nothing disturbing here. Just a couple of friends having an awesome dinner party.Officer 2: The neighbors said they heard some shouting.
Good stuff.  All right.   Let's get down to some wine drinking.
They need to be presented... royally... anyone?
Yes, I did, for you, princess.  Even though I only went number one.
And the neighbors blamed Jan.
So she's passed out, and some kids spray-paint a swear word on the neighbors' dog... J
Little trouble.  Yes.  Well, Jan fell asleep during her neighborhood watch shift.
Pam, when I first opened this catalog, I thought I was just going to be picking out a chair. P
I think I'm being very clear what I'm asking. Would an average size row boat support her without capsizing?  It bothers me that you're not answering the question. P
Is she a dress wearer or a pants wearer? Could we share a row boat? Could, could a row boat support her?
Hmm, I see, feisty. So she's not jolly or sassy? Not like a jolly, sassy opera singer? P
Well, now OK, I know that this is probably not appropriate, but I need help. Because I want to play ball with my kids before I get too old. And before that happens I need to get laid. And before that happens I need to be in love. And I don't wanna hear "Ahnnn... I can't help elhh la la." No. No. I'm a catch and I am not going to be the one who got away. So, this is what we're going to do. Dwight is going to hand out index cards and I want you all to write down the name of an eligible woman for me to date by the end of the day. No, by the end of the hour or you are fired. D
What part of shorn't don't you understand, Kevin? Look I could probably handle it, yes, but I think it would be a good exercise for you guys to do it yourselves. A
That would be bad.
Well, look, I am in an assigned parking place in front, so... Alright, alright, alright, umm let me try to think about what it would be like to not have one.  OK, yes that would be bad. K
Good. Good because this batch was awful. Umm... this one says chair model...
Oh, I'm sorry, could you put her on please?Wendy's phone o
Hello Wendy, this is Kevin's friend, Michael. Wendy's phone o
I don't, I don't think I'm ready. Is she hot?
Please, not at a time like this.
Try not to be so hurtful Jim.
Now you ruined it.
You wanna see what I walked out on? This is gonna blow your mind.  Look at that. M
She was so innocent. D
This'll be  the day that I died.
Dwight, little help with the bags, please.
Thank you, Dwight.
Okay.  All right, Dwight.  Take my money.  Go ahead.  Keep in mind that this whole thing was just a business transaction.  The late nights, the talks, the slumber parties, the crying jags, that was all business, that had nothing to do with friendship, and being friends.  Just ring me up.  Go ahead .
There was no other guest the entire time I was here.
You were charging me?  I'm your friend.
Oh.  What is this?
No, no, obviously older.
A cute little religious type, someone who wears a uniform, or...
Mmm... nah, that's too young.
That's hilarious.  What's her number?
Nothing.  Just hangin'.  Chillin'.  No agenda.  Would you consider hookin' me up with one of your friends?
Send me a picture.
You know, just a fun, guh, look, there, here, it doesn't have to be a model.  I'm not, don't rule out model, but just in terms of models, there are like twenty different categories.  There's face models, hand models, body models  - yes.
How 'bout a professional volleyball player who models on the side?
I'm not looking for a perfect 10 here, just somebody to hang out with.  Just fun, healthy young woman.
You don't have one single girlfriend? P
Hey, hey, hey. This is my hair we're talking about.
I don't feel like peanut butter. Get me an ice cream sandwich.
Kill me... right now.
I was walking in and I noticed something shinny under Stanley's car and I got under to see what it was and I messed up my hair, all for a stupid piece of tinfoil.
OK, let me be.
This just stinks. Don't touch it, please don't touch it.
I got gum in my hair.
Well just don't leave it on too long. Keep massaging please. Ah yeah, that's nice.
Oh don't. That's disgusting.
Ryan has done a very good job, and I am not applauding sarcastically. Think about it, a month ago nobody would go on this site because we were worried about getting molested, or losing our identity, having it stolen. But now, at a time TDB, all of the problems will be in the past. Ya done good kid, ya done good.
They sound great.
Well you tried.
Argh. Alright. Do you know any girls in New York you might want to hook me up with? Some that might be interested in a guy like me.
Oh Ryan, I need a girlfriend so bad.
That's still going on?
Who you dating?
Yes you can, you're single, I'm single. It'll be awesome.
Let's go to New York. We'll go clubbing with Ryan.
Jim, it's not the horniness, ok it's the loneliness that...
Do you think she'd keep it quiet?
That's... I, I think that...
I am going to go get laid. Goodbye.
Sorry Andy. Cannot take any chances on curses, not tonight. Let's go. Everybody, I will see you tomorrow, Saturday morning, probably wearing the same clothes that I am wearing right now, If you catch my drift.
No, they're just hotties.
Packed with beautiful babies. Swingers. Classic. John Favreau, tall guy from DodgeBall.
Let's do it!
Ryan, it's Michael and Dwight.
Well you know, just taking you up on your offer to party, so tada.
Oh ok, then just bring me two cups, one with olives and another filled with maraschino cherries.
Oh ok, all I know is I would like some chicken fingers and a Midori Sour.
Hey, nice to meet you.
You are welcome.
Oh, OK. Girl in C
Forty... I'm in my forties. Girl in C
Ahh, wow. That's dangerous.
I am a bank teller.
All right. Girl in 2nd c
I know, here we go.
Pretty weird.  You have to go with me.
All right, shhh.  Dwight, leave him alone.
Here we go, let's sit down.
Ahh, ooh!  D
Well, now I can say that I went to a museum.
No, I mean this apartment building, it's fantastic.  R
Frien..sss...yes, you're friends with a hobbit, and... look where you live.  I mean, you've got it all.
Not just because he said it? R
Dwight, I asked him. R
Do you remember what color my eyes are?
Do you ever miss us?
I... love it!! Haha, come on!
I love it more!
I love it!
No!! Come on, gimme something good!
Ahh come on!
Alright, hablbelah, come on, Phyl!
It's drying, it's drying...
Okay... Okay, do it! Go on! Great! Let's hear it!
Here we go!
Once in a lifetime opportunity people! Come on, here we go!
M.G.S.? No. Some idiot named Mark Greg Sputnik will claim credit for it. I don't...
Wet cement, outside. It's drying fast, come on. This is a lifelong dream. What do I write? What do I write?
That's what she said.
Ub, dub dah, don't need, I can't even hear you. It's just noise coming out of an ugly scientist. Um, everybody, we're going to have a little brainstorming session in the conference room.
...Good, this is good. I'm going to grab a glass of water.
We're havin a little brainstorm session...
Stanley, we're havin a little...
Yes you. Come on, Stanley, put your little game down and join the group.
An urban, yeah, Stanley? You wanna help us out with that?... Stanley, earth to Stanley...
Now we're cooking. I like this. Maybe a whole theme, like a rap. A rap rhyme...
Zing and pep, see that's those are the kind of words we're looking for. Yes, Jim?
Everybody, so how are we going to energize our office? I mean, I haven't done anything since Christmas. Pam, clearly, has just given up trying. So what we need to do is we get things going, we need to get percolating a little bit. Anybody have any ideas of what we could do. Any suggestions? Yes, Andy?
Well sometimes my stomach hurts when you come into my office, so it's probably psychological.
Okay, I will... I'm not feeling very well right now though. My stomach hurts, so I may be going home early today, but...
Well you don't get it, because Stanley is a beautiful, sassy, powerful black man, and you're... you. If you had any friends, you would understand. Friends joke with one a
We were joshin around, the two of us, and he said "did I stutter," and I said "wha-wha-wha-wha-what, dawg?" It was joking, Toby, alright?
That? In the conference room?
What are you blabbering about? Nothing happened.
Well, you know, uh, the thing that you said earlier, that you didn't mean, um, and that I forgive you for. The whole thing's silly, isn't it? Friends don't need to apologize to friends as far as I'm concerned, so we are cool.
I, uh, see that you... gave me that form that I asked you to give me, Stanley the manly, so thank you for that. I guess we are back to normal.
Okay, I will think about it.
I never said you could do that.
Other than me.
Ok... Is there anybody up here, anybody at all, that can deal with this?
What's the pink?
I would've never thought that gangs would be tickling each other.
What is that?
Yeah, right, so what do you do to get them to make it right?
Okay, so dig t
I knew it. Okay, who we talking about here? Crips? Bloods?
I know, it's very, very personal...
It's an advice question, and if you don't wanna talk about it, I completely understand. It's, um...
Darryl,  have you ever been in a gang?
I'm not firing him. I'm not, I need you to act like I am firing him. Just, what I'm going to do, is I'm going to pretend that I am firing him, and I need you to act like I am firing him. Do you get that? Do you get it? I'm teaching him a lesson. He needs to learn humility, alright? That's all I'm, okay, here he comes. Let's just... play act.  Stanley, may I talk to you for a second?
Because I want you to behave as if I'm actually firing him, Oscar, okay?
No, okay... I've had enough of you.
Yes it is a good idea. It's the only possible solution I have left.
It's like a mock execution.
Everybody, except Stanley.
Hey, STOP IT! Okay, everybody out.
All right, all right...
That's it. And uh... do you have anything to say to me?
Alright alright, okay, you know what? Now you know how I feel. This was a fake firing. Lesson learned. Good work, everybody. Very nice.
I am serious, we are all serious. You are fired like a heart attack.
All right, you don't respect me. I accept that. But listen to me, you can't talk to me that way in this office, you just can't. I am your boss. Can't allow it.
Well Stanley, maybe you're feeling that you don't respect me because you don't know me very well.
You just, do, and I don't know why, so... please help me understand.
Dammit, Phyllis. Alright, everybody out except Phyllis.
It's complicated, Pam.  I mean, the world looks a lot easier from behind your reception desk.  J
Well, he's just mean.
I know, I know.  I think it's tiny.  I think it's too small if anything.  And that your glasses make you look ugly.
And that Angela's a midget, and that  your chin is too big.
Because he's mean.  He's, he's like a really mean-spirited guy.  He talks about how gay Oscar is...
Like that people are stupid, and that they're idiots, and that they're sluts.
Everybody.  He just, he's always, he's always talking about people behind their backs to me.  P
Okay, here's what we're going to d
Like you're applying for a loan.
Why are you dressed like that?
Yes we will see Oscar, we will see, because a blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities! Conceptual! All right! We. Are. Open for business!   Hello!
This is all we need.
And that. Is why. I need a smart intern.
Oh, no problem.  And he signed!  He put his name on the piece of - okay, that was supposed to be a blank canvas on which to put their hopes and dreams. And he just, made it into a stupid piece of paper. We need another one, immediately.
How you doing? Listen, I don't think that a handsome, funny, smart, funny-looking kid like you, should limit himself. You could do whatever you want to do. You could be a classy janitor, or a cashier with dignity, or a... migraine worker.  Maybe for you, paper should be more of a hobby. J
He's totally wrong, Pam.  Hey.
Hey, uh, remember what we talked about, in the car on the way up, "only the best and the brightest." P
Well it's funny that you should ask, because it's really more than a company... O
Who cares? I'm not there, Jim's not there, why should they have to be there?
Yes. And don't call me Shirley.
Pam-Pam-Pam-Pam-PamPamPamPam! We're dying here. I want you to go back to the office and I want you to get the real stuff. I want you to get ultra white card stock.
This isn't Dunder Mifflin paper. Some sort of Pendleton crap.
This... just in. Justin Polznik! Huh?
Just-in case. What's your last name?
Why don't... hey.
I, uh, hmm.
No, I didn't. You misconstrued me.
So, what do you think? Think these guys are nice? The guys I didn't bring are even better. Justin, I'm willing to commit right now. Would you do me the honor, of spending the summer with us, at Dunder Mifflin? I think, I think you are very special.
Come here. I would never say this to her face, but she is a wonderful person and a gifted artist.
This is Darryl Philbin. Isn't he big? And you already met her, Pam Beesly, office hottie. She will "do" you.  No, no. But she has already dated two guys in the office, that we know of, so, this could be number three, you never know?
Hold down the fort, I have to do something.  Air Force is cool. The refreshments? Bush league! You know, that's not what you want. Dunder- they,  well, okay I see security is coming so I just want to say, come to Dunder Mifflin. Dunder Mifflin, a great place to work! Anybody? Show of hands, anybody want to intern at Dunder Mifflin?  We do not offer college credit, we cannot give you any sort of pay, but it is a really fun work environment. Anybody? Show of hands? Damn... it. Okay, I'm gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
Don't fold it, though.
That's called card stock.  That's what you're feeling.  Now what you're feeling inside is confusion, butterflies, exhilaration... You're thinking, "Am I good enough for this job?  Do I have what it takes?"  And I think we both know the answer.  We'll find that out together.  You can keep that.
You get to look at her.  Why don't you hold out your hand.  Tell me what you feel.
She sits there all day.  B
Check that out, huh?
receptionist extraordinaire. B
Sales is and could be very, very cool.  If you like paper, and you love to laugh, this is the place for you.
So, what is your poison?  You like uh, sales, accounting, customer service, what do you like...
That is a very firm handshake.  Ow, ow, aahch!  Killing my hand, there.
And do your worst.
Okay, be my guest. B
Yeah, me, too.
Hey, you know what?  Coincidence - I am going to go for a little stroll myself.  Are you psyched about the summer?
One other thing I wanted to...
So, I forgot to mention that my old temp is now my boss, so, gives you an idea of how quickly you can move up in this...
Wait, you want this kid to be in the Air Force?Air Force r
I think you are smart, and capable, and you aim high.
Well, yeah, but you don't need the brochure.  The brochure is up here  J
I thought that you might say that.
Like a beach blowout? Or a toga, toga-
If the Devil were to explode, and evil were gone forever, what sort of party would you have?
Okay, well, this will not do. Toby is going away forever, and uh, we need to do something very very special. In some cultures, when somebody leaves, like New Orleans culture, they have a parade and they have a band and people party in the streets...
Phyllis, can you do this?
Exactly. A little old-fashioned hazing.
We need to sell her an elevator pass.
Yeah! It would! Just have a thought. Have an original thought. Although, I will agree that her head is weird. You know what we need to do?
You know, Dwight, sometimes... I don't know, I think you say things just to agree with me.
Why do you hate her?
Well, we know that Toby thinks she'll be great. So, strike one, I hate her already.
Toby's replacement. Ugh. Wow.
T-No. He tortured me... with his awfulness.
Hi. Yeah. Right. Okay, well, they hired a female Toby. Good for the world. Thank you, God, for creating two of you. Here's how things work h
No. I think I will pass.
Oh, hey, do you still work here?
You know, I should make you a mix. Do you have a, uh, a CD player?
Oh... What, um, what is your commute like? How long does it take to get in?
I bet. Are these guys boring your ears off?
Here she is! Holly... You know, if we hung Holly from the ceiling, we'd have to kiss underneath of her. So-I know. Oh, sorry. Question, are you real, or are you a Hollygram?
I don't want her to get away.
This thing with Holly feels a lot like love to me.
Yeah, you took it too slow.
Like, with who?
Well, you're not a romantic.
Well, it was love at first sight. Actually, it was-no, it was when I heard her voice. It was love at first see with my ears.
I think I do.
Hey, what's the group that was from Scranton that made it big? Was that U2?
And "I... love you."
The two levels being, uh, "Welcome to Scranton"...
And I'm looking for perfect songs that work on two levels.
For a CD mix tape...
So are you in down this weekend? Cause, I'm not-I'm not... I'm not gonna be in town. I'm going out of town.
And the sequel, "Woman Stands at Desk and Works." So, I have no idea how you,  how you sit like that.
Hello, Holly.  Woah, what are you doing? You don't, uh, you don't have to do that. I mean, we have already put-together chairs. That's how we buy them actually.
Whew, oh God.  Laying a base. Laying a base...
It was hard. I wanted to kiss her.
I talked to her-Holly. Just pleasantries, nothing, you know... not like, do you want kids or, religion, or what side of the bed do you want. Hey, I can take either side of the bed at this point.
Yes we do.
Oh, there he is. Thought you had gone home already. Why don't you go home, and come back for the party?
I'll kill you.
No no no no no. I'm not asking it. I'm just reading it out loud.
Well, no no no no no...
Thank you.  What would you improve about Dunder Mifflin?
Sure. You know what? That sounds good. I'll take a little look-see.
Yeah. Correct. Um... What gives-what-what gives you the right?
Um... Alright, well then, I will proceed.  I just have some questions that I was gonna ask. Um... Who do you think you are?
Um, no, no, no. This is very boring stuff. Why don't you take a tour? Have you seen the baler?
I'm just having a little exit interview.
Hey! Hi, good to see you.
Can I just say that, of all the idiots, in all the idiot villages, in all the idiot worlds, you stand alone, my friend.
Hey, that's good.
Well... That's my watch.
How did you know?
...Yes, I am. That was it. How did you know that?
I am going to give Toby...
My gift is forthcoming, Pam.
Okay, you know what that is? You know what that is? That is... a psyche. Psyche. So, that is not my real gift to Toby.
That's... What do you mean, "Michael"? That's not even my handwriting.  Hey! What the hell is going on here?! Who thought it would be hysterical to give Toby a rock for his going-away gift?!
What the hell is that?
Oh, no no no, no, no. No, this-hey, hey, hey, hey, this might not be what I think... that I don't even know is in there, because there are a lot of presents in my car, and I don't know which is which...
Just, I'm fine. I'm holding it together. I-I have a business to run.
I'm just worried about my friend.
Ferris wheel's pretty cool though.
No antigravity machine, huh?
That's what she... a lot of places are like that.
No. There is no such thing as playful hazing. Dwight, I want you to look at Holly right now. Everybody, I want you to look at Holly right now, and maybe if you look at her deeply enough, you will see what I see in her. And that is that we are all very lucky to have her here. Holly is the best thing that has happened to this company since World War II. Fifty years, she is the best.  Take care of that, all right?
Why did you do that?
There is a raccoon in the car, Dwight!
What the hell is going on here?!
Hey. What are you doing?
I like, uh...
It was early morning yesterday... I was up before the dawn... and I really have enjoyed my stay... Toby must be movin' on.
I love to sing them, but I am not going to be doing that today. I am going to be doing something I wrote specifically for Toby.  Do you know, um, "Goodbye Stranger"? Supertramp?
Or, "Total Eclipse of the Fart."
I have done things like um, "Beers in Heaven."
Probably the best one that we have ever had, right?  But the real reason that we are here, is to say goodbye to a guy who we will probably never ever see again. Now, a lot of you know that I am an accomplished songwriter.
Yeah, that's true. Don't move a muscle. I will be back momentarily, all right?  No, you can drink-you can finish your drink and then I'll-okay, I'll be back.
Yeah. He's at the supermarket and he needs me.
What is it?
Just pay for it and we'll reimburse you when you get back.
Oh, okay. Yeah. Well, actu-too soon. It's uh, it's uh, very sexual.  Kevin, where are you? You missed my song, buddy.
Oh, hey. Thanks.
Thanks, Kevin. Um...
Wow, Kevin, really? We're-  Is this why you called me down here?
O-kay. Hello Jan.
You'd rather have somebody else's sperm than my sperm?
W-I don't understand. You always used to be very cautious... I'd wear two condoms.
When we were going out?
So it's mine, and it's not somebody else's, so... I know... the whole toilet seat thing is a myth, so...
Well, okay... J
You cheated on me... when I specifically asked you not to?
Because you're pregnant, and because it obviously happened when we were together. And, I am very...
Wow, I am so happy. I am so deliriously happy...
Good. Good. Thank God.
Do you-do you have cravings? You never touched my Propecea, or my Accutane, did you?
Um, I'll... I have to think about it.
I'm glad you told me.
Have a good night.
Oh, um, well, you know what? You should go to the Glider Diner. Ask Stanley about that. Practically lives there.
Well, I can see Andy proposing to Angela. I can also see him proposing to Oscar.  Oh...
Okay, security guard.
You might take something.
Sorry. Corporate policy.
...blah, blah, overstaying your welcome!  Let's keep it moving!  Let's keep it moving!  Toby, everybody!
Blah, blah, blah, blah...
Ach,  okay, okay, play the cutoff music.  D
Toby has written a fantastic speech for you, he spent a year on it.  It's very funny and charming and heartwarming.  And it rhymes, and if it's not any good, he has instructed us all to storm the stage and beat him to a bloody pulp.   No!  So, take it away, Toby!  Whoo!
Come on, no, no, no.Co-
Oh, Pamcake. No, no, no. We would love your extra poundage, but you are going to be leaving us next week, so vamoose. Vamoose, Pam. Dunder Mifflin family only.
OK everybody. Get used to this because we are going to be standing here briefly every Monday for the next seven Mondays.
No, I will ex-squeeze you.
I thought you had to pee.
And that her butt refuses to quit!
I learned that she broke her left leg twice in one year. I learned that she's allergic to sesame seeds. I learned that she has read "Lonesome Dove" three times.
Did you see Holly's butt?
All right, call--
I took a lot from other poems.
No. OK. Um, the last word is "seagulls."
I wrote you a goodbye poem. It's really long. I left it up in my office. Could you just please wait till I go get it?
Yes, it does. No, this is about weight displacement. We have to have the same weight distribution. Right here. Here we go. Let's move that up. Here we go.
Let's go. We are following Pam to the supply shelf. Let us go.
Oh, calm down, weirdo. It's just a joke. She's such a weirdo! You know what? My real beef with her, though, Pam? She can't find those little colored paper clips that I like so much. Will you help her find them, please?
Pam, I'd like you to meet Ronnie. We call her Rice-a-Ronnie. She is hilarious. She is wonderful, a beam of light in this dark, dark office. Not really so much. All she does is plop herself down there and answer phones all day.
No way. No way. Pam Beesley. Hello.  Hey, everybody look, Pam. Pam, say hi. Say hi to Pam. Don't we all look skinny? Oh, oh, almost dropped you!
Damn it. Come on.
Here we go. Everybody on.
Are you kidding me? We only lost one pound, Phyllis.
Cake? Who suggested cake?
This is how we're gonna do it. Five pounds. I'm asking each of you to lose five pounds. That plus Jim's 65 will give us a very good chance at winning this thing.
If you gain weight, you will die. I want you to live forever. I want us all to live forever. How? How are we going to do this?
Yes, all right. Who else?  Can I put you down for 10 pounds?
Thank you. Holly is right. People, this is not just about winning some extra vacation days. This is about a very cool HR initiative that if we don't follow, we are all going to die of obesity. So how much are we gonna lose?
You want more?
Wait a second.  I don't want you to end up with a surprise pregnancy like me.
You know what? We're pretty much done here today. Why don't you just take off early?
Um, I think you'll have fun. Men from Scranton are handsome, and they know how to show a woman a good time.
Let's go mini-golfing.
You know what we should do? We should have a party and not invite them.
You know, we're gonna have to try a little harder if we are going to win this thing.
And what is that?
OK, everybody. Phyllis, did I or did I not say fruit?
Hey, you know what?  I can't do this by myself people!  Kelly and I are the only ones who have either passed out or almost passed out.
Mmm--- mmm...  Um...
I should have been lovers with her first and then friends.  That was terrible advice.  Terrible advice!  You know my seduction method.  I like to get in there and get my hands dirty! Wh---  You sabotaged me.  You sabotaged me, man!
Your stupid friend zone.
Gah, the dreadmill.
I say, I say, I say, I say down Holly! I'll take it from here. I am beautiful.  They are beautiful. He is beautiful.  This big fat pig is beautiful.
Ohhhh!  Bang!  Boom!  Say Clump! Why hello everybody!
We're doing this because of you.  So why don't you just go stand somewhere else.   Hey.  Hey.  You shaved?
Hey!  Why don't you just sit down, please?
No, no, no, NO, no!  You know what?  Fat people are not monsters!  Why don't you guys have a little more sensitivity to the subject.  Bang!  Boom!  Case in point!  Look at the outside of this building.  It is ugly.  But you come inside... and it is beautiful.  Just like this unappealing fat suit.  Inside is a rather handsome, sexy, man.
How dare you! Michael Clump is a celebration of fat people.
How do you know Michael Clump?
If it's me, then society made me that way.  Now, I know a lot of you are probably asking yourself, "Why are you dressed in a plus sized suit?"
What about her looks?
Ok, be more specific.
You're right, you're right.  Just, Dwight, do it.  Just say it ok.
Ok Phyllis, thank Dwight first.
I want you to know.  Kelly, look at me!   I want you to know that you are beautiful.  You are truly, truly beautiful.  Give me a hug.   Mmmmmm.
Excellent!  Good job.
Oscar, enough with the girl talk please.
Wait, do we have until the end of the day?
I dunno.  I always call everybody back right away.  He'll call back though.  Give him until the end of the day, he'll call.  If he doesn't, he is loco.
No no, did, I heard you talking to Oscar about that guy.  What, what happened?  Did he call?
Ok, that is fine.  Just water, and be back by weigh-in, ok?
We're trying to win a contest here, Kelly.  Please?
Nonono, no, no, I don't want to hear moaning.  This is a good day.  You guys accomplished something big.  You lost a ton of weight, literally.  A lot of weight.  And I don't care what any stupid scale says.  You guys are all gigantic losers.
Darryl, would you do the honors?
Is that good?
Alright.  Alright!    Just, I want you to just forget about him, ok?  Case closed.  Umm, can I pay you tomorrow?  I have like a 60 dollar limit on my ATM, so...
I do.  No.  I do.  I, I want to.  Trust me.  I really do.
That's a shame.  A shame to waste these.  I want to buy them from you.
I know.  I love Counting Crows.
...was that he was a complete stupid idiot.
I have to say, I think the problem with that whole thing...
No, you know what we're gonna do?  We're gonna take that and we are going to us it as a reward for the end of our competition.  D
Hey, Oscar!  Come on, let's go!
I want you to get your ass out of my face.
Okay, no, I am not.  Dwight!   I want you to take Jim's chair.  No!  No!  His chair at his desk.  He gets it back on Friday.
You're...you know what?  I read in one of those books that you're not even supposed to give foot massages because it can induce labor.
I want you to get the panty liners.
I really, I don't want to get panty liners, please...
To be married?
What's going on?
That's crazy.  That's crazy talk!  Meredith!  The Merenator, sleepin' with suppliers!  Hoo-ooh!  Wow!  What time we got?  Great job.  I am truly impressed.  That, uh, you really pulled that one out.  Classic.  Classic meeting.  We should celebrate.
Well, let's keep this party movin' on.
Who hasn't?  Good.  Good!  What else?
You are a thief of joy.  Anybody else.  Yeah?
Yeah, .  Come on, anybody.  Let it fly.
To tell you or not.  And I'm glad I did.  I feel very very good.  Cathartic.  I promise you that you are not going to get into trouble.  You can say anything you want with total and complete immunity.
I will go first.  When I discovered YouTube I didn't work for five days.  I did nothing.  I viewed Cookie Monster sings Chocolate Rain about a thousand times.
Anybody?  This is a chance for you to say something without any repercussions.  Stanley?  Oscar, come on.
I would not... steal the bread.  And I would not let my family go hungry.
enough with the pencils.
Do you... just... you're kind of losing them.
Do some... do some work.  People expect a lot from these meetings.  Laughter, sudden twists.  Surprise endings.  You need to be Robin Williams and M. Night Shyamalan.  You need to be Robin Shyamalan.
Can we have a moment?   Can I talk to you for a sec?  Lot of good stuff. And you look... you look fantastic.
Can't set 'em up like that.
Well, I think we can all totally agree that Holly is totally fantastic.
Ok.  Well done.  Good speech Ryan, you're a good guy.
No... no, this is just a stupid formality.
Meredith, why don't you tell Holly... it's not what she thinks.  Nothing unethical happened... and that you just like to sleep around.
Oh no, no, no.  Your food is no good here, my lady.    Sorry!  You know what?  Let's go out!  Dunder Mifflin's treat.  Um, actually you're not a client... so... we'll just split it?  Ethical.
Good.  Would you care to bang it out over lunch?
Hoo-ooh!  Reaching!  You'll get there.  Anyway, I was giving it some thought, and there's no reason that two attractive, good looking, intelligent, funny, attractive people can't, you know, just... sit down and work this whole Meredith thing out. H
Well, well.  Holly... lujah!  It's a miracle, you're at your desk.
Wow, terminator, terminator.
Yeah, get the boring stuff out of the way.  Autumn was what I was going to say.  When the leaves change.  It's just, I... I think it is the most contemplative of seasons.
Here too.  You know what my favorite season is?
Wow, that sounds so... warm.
Istn't it?  Yeah, it's kind of... business/romantic.  So you're from Des Moines?
What do you think?  What do you think of this place?
No, it's more of a underwear garment that has little spikes like made of, sometimes they are made of metal.  You know what I am talking about.  You unlock a little door that... down... where you, where you put, where you put the...
I don't know.  I saw this thing, like a belt with a key.
Mmhmm, tell her she can't have sex for six months.
Ok, new idea.  We don't report it at all.  We just punish her.
Well, you have to tolerate a lot when you are part of a family.
Well... bleh busted.  I don't...
Let the record show that it was during the immunity part of the seminar.
I don't know.  Can you?  Kendall, my main man.
You get me.
What's the only thing worse than one HR rep?
Now is really not the time, Meredith.
Get in there right now or I'm gonna lose it!
Ok, everybody listen up.  If you are not in that conference room in two minutes I am going to kill you.
Let's keep this rollin'... Ryan?
I... really want to keep you.
What do you need?
Oh, cr..., oh, God.  Meredith, you know what?  I just need a minute, okay?
OK, just remember to keep breathing.
Do it! Do it!  Scream!  Scream it out, scream it out, scream it out.
All right, OK.  Sorry.  Sorry.  Here we go.  Here we go!
Andy, would you like to have my baby?
I checked the route - there are no potholes.  Come on, get in here and have the baby.
I take Quincy Ave to Gibson.
I get a call from Jan and I meet her at the hospital.
Oh, OK! OK!
Nice touch.  Good.  Let's try that again.
Aaaaaaaa!  It's coming!  Here we go!  Oh! God! Wow! What was on that?
Yes, I do!
No.  You have to just push it out!
Shhh. No, you can't have it.  It's too late.
All right.  Dwight.  Just push and breathe.
I'm right here, I'm right here.
I'm right here.
I know.  I know.  It is beautiful.  No.  Thank you.  Is this it? I mean, is this... Two bowls of M&Ms and some balloons?  You know what Phyllis, I think you need to step it up.  I think you need to get the lead out.  Because if I'm not mistaken, we gave you your wedding shower here.  We all came into this room and gave you a golden shower.  Well you know what, where's my golden shower, Phyllis?
She said it is the name of a Viking princess. So...
Damnit, Phyllis!  I'm sorry.   Damnit, Phyllis.  It was hard enough to convince Jan to come.  So are we set for refreshments?
Make the party.  Don't - make the party, please, Phyllis.  Pump it!
Hey, hey.  What are you doing?  Don't talk to them.
Um, listen.  Jan Levinson is coming in today, and she is in the terminal stages of her pregnancy - the child of which I have a vested interest.  It's all kind of weird.  Anyway, she is incredibly... fat and enormous right now - extremely unattractive.  And you are, on the other hand, one of the more attractive people in the office.  So, while she's here I am going to be acting kind of cold to you.  And I am doing this to pay respect to her bloated feelings.  And I'm treating Ryan the same way.
Ahoy. So, how you doin'?
All right, OK.
Can I hold her?
No, I don't!
Oh, man. Him? That guy? He had no sense of humor and I proved him wrong in so many ways.
I could have helped.
Oh, OK.  Why didn't you call me?
OK, come on, let's get our shower on. Conference room, choppity chip chop.
...trid Levinson.  Hi!  Astrid, this is everybody, look.  This is your family.  You're going to know them for the rest of your life.  J
OK, what else?
She already has a stroller.
Whatta we got?
All right, how about some presents?  I want to see some presents.  I got this so I can write down for thank-you notes.
No, the baby doesn't ruin anything, Kevin, OK?  The baby multiplies the fun.  Let's just do what you were going to do.
Hey! Hey, no no no no no no no no. No.  No.  This is the birth story. It was beautiful. It was beautiful.  This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.  And I should have been there. I should have been there to witness this.
Phyllis?  Could you take-.
I usually love babies, but when I held Astrid I just felt... shortchanged.
Uh, yeah. J
That's not a baby.
It's- that's different.
Why, Darryl, because I'm quote white quote unquote?
I just saw this baby daddy-
Yeah, I a baby daddy.  Um, when you first became a baby daddy, did you have an immediate connection with that baby?  Like, the first time that you held it, did you find that with your baby baby?
Uh, I need some advice from one baby daddy to another.
I was just going to...  I was going to talk to Holly, about her hygiene.  She smells like old tomatoes and dirt.
All right.  All right, everybody, we're leaving.  Jan and Astrid are leaving.
Wha - that's, I hate her.  Wha - God!  Why would you even ask me to - I, I mean, not that it matters, 'cause I don't, but wha - OK, all right, fine.
You wanna go out?
Hey! HR lady, stop whispering in the corner please.  Very rude.  You're ruining the party.
Do the boobs!
Too many times. It's all good, um, alright, so, good, so, have a nice day.
Wow... Oh, wait a second, I can't tonight...
Okay. Oh, wait, oh, tonight's no good.  Because I am busy taking you out.
So, when, um, can I see you again?
I, uh...  I let her win.
I'm actually thinking about getting my own set of putt-putt golf clubs.
That was really fun last night.
Okay, so, we do the restaurant thing and then... then... then we can do... We'll just do the restaurant thing first.
Some of what we order depends on whether we're having sex after.  Oh, my. Wow, elephant in the room. Are we, do you think? Do you think we're going to have sex tonight?
No. No. Reservations are at 8:00, so we've got like an hour and 45 minutes.  I'm a crazy eight, I'm crazy.
We're totally alone.
Not if we turn these dials  Now they can't hear us at all.
Do you need 'em?
Oh my God!
Oh, no, my God. H
No, did you?
Yeah. Oh... oh!
I don't know, it could be any number of people. It could be a pedestrian. It could be an old person. It could be a lookie-loo. Or, it could be... a Bruce Springsteen fan - what? Who said that? I did. Why did I say that? Oh, I think you know why I said that. I think it is very apparent. I think it goes without saying. Bear with me. There's a point there. But what is the point? I don't understand what he's saying. It seems a little shady. It seems a little foggy. Well, it's not a little foggy there's actually something going on here-
Okay. Okay! Well, come on, let's have an auction. Let's do this. We'll auction off people like in the olden days.
Okay, I'm gonna have to stop you right there. Was this a sorority that you didn't get into a real sorority so you had to kind of form your own?
Twice. ... Right?
Yeah, I think that's pretty boss.
Okay. Okay, sold! Have fun, you guys. Well, this next item is sure to spring steam from your ears if you don't win it. It just says "Creed."
Oh, yes, great. Very good, Um, so, Darryl, and the boys in the hood in the warehouse, have graciously donated to, uh, go out for a beer with them right now. You know what, I'm actually going to bid on this. I'm going to start the bidding, because this is something that I have dreamt of-
It squeaks when you bang it, that's what she said. Let's hear it for me! Right? A bargain at any price!
Okay, alright. Hey, you know what? I would appreciate it if people would stop storming off the stage.
Federal and State.
Let's hear an opening bid, everybody. Who's first? Kevin do your taxes. He's the tax man. Kevin the tax man.
Keep it going. Hey batter batter batter.Guy in a
100 dollars, great.
1,000 going once, 1,000 going twice. Sold for 1,000 dollar.  Nicely done.
500 and one penny. One million dollar!
400 and one penny.
350 and one penny.
325, 325.David W
300 and one penny, 300 and one penny.
300, we have 300. 300 going once. 300 going twice.
Uh, what the hell is happening?
She's your wife, you idiot.
Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody... really wants a hug, so.
No. I think they were stolen. I think they were stolen and they're gone forever. So... oh, that was the last good item. So, good job, everybody.
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right! Here we go. All right, big ticket item.  All right, in my pocket, I have... two tickets... to Mr. Bruce Springsteen, front... Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around? S
Uh, just a few more items.
Even as pie.
You know what?  I would love a slice of real New York style pizza.
Hey, if there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
Oh, I guess that job that I got you is working out for you well, then.
Times have changed, Jim.
Well, I thought as the man that I should make the decision.
What do I do?
Really?  I don't know.  It's a big third date, Jim.
And we have sex on it.
We go to the bed store, I let her choose whatever bed she wants...
Number two, we go to the mall...
Exactly.  Here, here are my sure things.  I blindfold her.  I take her to the Houdini Museum.  She chains me up...
The wildcard is dinner at a nice restaurant.
I have two sure things, one wildcard.
We're not doing anything.
Oh, copy that breaker. Those Duke boys are at it again.
Road trip!  Right?
Ah, you are quite the gentleman.
We're gonna switch back and forth, the driving. Sometimes we'll just meet in the middle. It'll be fun. Wait a sec. Oh I love this song.Michael and H
Halfway! Okay, You know what I want to do, I want to pull over and find little bed and breakfast for when we meet in the middle. Emphasis on the bed. And the breakfast.
All right. What's the scoop, how far?
Was I?  Really? Was I saying anything interesting?
Ah! Ah! Ahhhh!   Hey. Whew. Ow. I was having a nightmare.
Yeah. I don't know I just- I imagined a hotel right here. Pool, over here. Really good breakfast place. With really good bacon.
Did Darryl touch you?
That's what she said.
I've dated almost four women, and you are so far above them, it is stupid.
Not last - no. In like the last ten years.
And I've dated four women in the last--
Oh no no no.. It's gonna work, it'll be fine.
Sure it is.
My wish has come true, incidentally, because, you've met me, and you are happy.
Here's my wish. I want you to meet a great guy, and I want you to be happy.
Maybe I'll see an accident one weekend?
Okay, okay. I will talk to you on the Bluetooth the entire trip. So we're talking constantly all the way. H
No I won't! I'm not strong! And I'll go back to Jan, and I hate Jan! Oh God!
Then don't do it. Please don't do this. Please don't do this.
I'll be down in just a second.  Holly?
You know I have some things I need to do this weekend. I just remembered, so, I'll just ride back with you.
Da  na na na na...
Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na!! D
Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na.
Da  na na na na.
That's a really pretty song. D
We didn't break up.
This is gonna be awesome. This is gonna be awesome. I've decided that on my drives to Nashua, I am going to learn French, the language of love. And on my drives back, I am going to learn Spanish; what the cleaning crew speaks.
I do! Hey, come on!
The man has a point.
I'm gonna do it.
Oh, shoot! Okay. All right. All right.  Pull it over. Here we go.
Cow surfing.  Okay, here we go, there's a cow.Holly & D
Okay, okay. What kind of car games did you play in the 'hood?
Yeah. Right, snuggle time.
Watch this. Darryl, watch this.
Here we go.
You're better. You're better than my best.
You're the best.
No, you are.
Come on, it'll be fun.
Absolutely. Oh, and you know what, Darryl? You are invited to go as well.
We get right in the car, we pop up to Montreal. It's like another seven hours.
I didn't ask.
I'll save you! I'm Superman! Scooperman!
Say what you said.
Mmm mmm! Remember the 15-scooper we had last week? Wasn't that good? I was Scooperman, you were Scoopy-Doo. Remember what you said? You were laughing.
Seven deadly sins. It's a sign.
That is a lucky number. Seven. 7-Up. Seven dwarfs.
Can we have another? I think I blinked.
Oh, you have your own entrance. That's nice.
I'm not, I'm not getting married. So...  Psych.
Why do you always do that? Whenever I'm getting married, you don't believe me.
Mom, I'm getting married.
That's -- thanks.
I don't want to do that.  She is going to freak out!
I'll call her later.
Nope. Nope. Not yet.
Oh, wow, so quickly.
Yeah, so there you go.
No, we would never do that. And if we did, it would be with Jim and Pam.
I'll take care of that for you.  Thanks.
And I'm out a fiancee. Are those the customer surveys?
If I were joking, you would be laughing. Do you look like you are laughing?
Do I look like I am joking?
No, no, no, no, no.
A number of your clients found your personal style abrasive and distasteful.
Dwight, your feedback is horrible.
Jimbo, let's do this thang.
Jim, they are a poopy.
And there's our smudgeness.
So let's see what we can find out from reading.  Jim Halpert is smudge and arrogant.
No.  Yes, I am sure, Jim. It --
...  It's a million-dollar sale.
See what I did?
Hello, Mr. Buttlicker. How may we help you?
Hello, this is Michael Scott, regional manager.
Give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.
Here we go.
That is totally inappropriate. You never yell at the client. You never yell at the client.
Stop it! Stop it!
He's hard of -- he's an old man. Let's go.
Boundaries, Dwight. Come on!
It's up to you to change his mind.
Be respectful, Dwight.
Ask him his name.
Boom! Yes. Now, Jim is going to be the client. Dwight, you're going to have to sell to him without being aggressive, hostile or difficult. Let's go.
I think you should do that.
I have an enormous amount of trouble trying to get people to come to my place. And I hate it. I can't tell you how much leftover guacamole I have ended up eating over the years. I don't even know why I make it in such great quantities. Here's what we're gonna do. We are going to sit here for a while, make it look good. And maybe you should cry. Can you make yourself cry?
I will call you when it is time.
Yes. Jim, Dwight, please excuse us.
You were lying.
Don't. Don't. Get away from that, Dwight, please. You know what? She's got a point about you two. You do have a problem dealing with people.
You cannot say "I was raped" and expect all of your problems to go away, Kelly. Not again. Don't keep doing that. I'll give you one last chance to come clean. Just tell me what happened.
What's going on?
Dwight.  I was informed by these gentlemen that the reports that you filed may not entirely be accurate.
Why don't you tell us?
The ring, 10-carat diamond, pops out of her mouth, hits her shrimp cocktail, right onto her finger. Million-to-one shot. All of the Greek people in the restaurant start screaming "Opa!" Which means "congratulations," so...
How did I propose, let me see... well, I drove her up to Nashua, and I had the ring, a big 10-carat diamond; it was beautiful. And I got down on my hands and knees, and a shooting star crossed overhead, and it just lit up the diamond like a shooting star. And we were in a restaurant, and I put the diamond into a cheeseburger. Kevin & A
Maybe go to Sandals, Jamaica. Or the other Sandals, Jamaica. I just don't want to go by myself.
I'm pretty much devastated.
Intensive one-on-one retraining will begin after lunch. That is all.
I am jetting off on an international business trip.
I am ashamed at your naked face. I must cover it with my jacket.  You are now sexy in your culture.
Well I'll just... I'll use different money for that.
I have my per diem.  I already know what I am going to spend this on.  I am going to buy a sweater.David W
I have my passport. David W
They have one of those?
Well that is all in the past.David W
Dwight, can you get those please?
Its not just a van.
There we go. Our town car awaits.
Yeah baby! That's what I'm talking about. That could be you  if you hadn't forgotten French.  Where is my numbers man?
There he is.
Okay.  Where is my translator?
Stop it! Stop it!
No, I don't want to wear a bra.
I do. It's right here.
Two are for souvenirs.
Oh... okay.  GAH!
Um. I'd like to see a menu please.
Could you have picked something stinkier to bring on a plane?  My God, Oscar. Really? Do you have a bag of baby poop in there too, to share with everybody? No, I will be ordering my own food, thank you very much.
Hey... guys, check it out.  My own personal DVD player and 20 movies.
Yes, this is Beth.  This is my personal valet/flight attendant and she will be helping me this morning.
You want one of your own? I can hook you up.
Take a sip of that.
Handed to me as I sat down.  This was my hot towel.  It is still wet.
Wow! Wow, I am blown away by this. I, um... I--ah! This is great, thank you!
Yes! Wallace said there would be one of those.
Thank you, Andy.
Oh, thank you.
She's foreign.  I am--
And it is, how do you say, a beautiful night---
...who works at our hotel.  You look, how do you say, radiant tonight.
Works in accounting.  This is uh, concierge Marie...
Um, this is my associate uh, from Dunder Mifflin, uh, Oscar Martinez.
Excuse me, hello. Concierge Marie. Michael Scott.  Good to see you again.
Let's do this.
---and everything's closed and you need to get some dry cleaning done. 12:00 midnight. Where do you go? What do you do?  What do you do? Come on! What do you do?
Slept like a baby.
Look, people continue to come back to us time and time again because they feel cared for here.  They feel respected and they feel that their needs matter.  They are treated like human beings.
That was a really sucky thing to do.David W
No, David. You listen to me.  Why did you send her away? That--- God.  You knew I liked her and you just sent her away.  And that--- that was a sucky thing to do man.Dacvid W
That was a really good choice.David W
Oh and thanks for the tip on the concerige.  That was great.  That was great.  That was--- that was a---Dacvid W
It was not, it sucked.David W
And business class which was basically just coach. And the hotel which sucked big time.David W
I did not like the trip. Well, starting with her airport shuttle which was basically just a van.David W
The trip sucked, David. It blew chunks. It was terrible. It was a bad trip.David W
No. Actually the trip sucked.David W
Yeah, we locked him up for two years.David W
NOOOO! GOD! No, God, please no! No! No! NOOO!
Hmmm, dare I?
I don't know.  What?
Oh, can you imagine?
Yeah, they used to.
She said she was going to give it to him right now.
Heh, okay, weirdo.
Oh brownies! I'm taking two so I can parcel them up and eat them at my leisure later on, much healthier.
He looks worse.
Not on the surface, no, but I can tell people are disturbed, David.
Uh, well I'm afraid not.  Toby Flenderson, of H.R., has made a sudden reappearance.  D
Don't do that.
I have cause.  It is be-cause I hate him.
Is there no way we can get rid of him?
That's true.  People say it's icky.
I did not want to go back to the annex because that is where Holly worked whom I loved.
Yeah, I am.  I am.
Shhh hot, why didn't you get an air-condition--- should have gotten an air-conditioner for yourself.
I bet, for you.
Why'd you come back?  Why didn't you stay?
Nice beaches, pristine beaches?
So Costa Rica that was - did you have fun?  That must have been fun.
You're welcome.  Missed you.  Missed you as part of our family.
Yes, sure they do, Dwight.
No, for one thing, he's not gay.  And if somebody were to be bait it would be Jim.  Or Ryan.  Or me.
You're the bait for Toby?
No, no, no.
What are you doing?
Mm.  Me too.  Okay, let's get this started.
That's it, that's it, perfect.  We will get him to hit on somebody, and then we will catch him in the act.
Pam.  Pam, you gave me your word.
Good.  N-no no no, don't.
Okay, what I would like you to do is take this folded note, and deliver it to Toby Flenderson?  I just want you to just react to whatever this note elicits.  Do not read it beforehand.  Can you do that for me?
Oh, oooh his mistress.  No. I'm kidding.  No one would ever cheat on you; you are the complete package, Pam.
Pamtown lady sing this song, doo-dah doo-dah.  Hello, Pam.  Jim may I have a moment with Pam please.
Son of a bitch.
Not, not as hard as you can, just a good, solid punch.  Come on! Come oooon...
No do it, do it.  I dare you.
Hey hey! Come on, Ryan, who's side are you on?
What's the matter... haaaww!
Huh?  He might do it...
Do you want to do that?  You want to hit me, you want to punch me?
You mad? You mad at me?
Toby can I see those? Ooh.  What's the matter?  What's the matter? You scared?
Um, I got some photos from Costa Rica if you want to see them?
Just seems awfully mean.  But sometimes the ends justify the mean.
I've never framed a man before, have you?
How much? How many pounds is it?Vance Refrigeration G
I'm not wearing a wire, so...
I heard you drug---  I heard you dealt.Vance Refrigeration G
No. Uh, I wanted--- I wanted to buy some weed? Some...Vance Refrigeration g
Hey, hey, hey.  Hey.  I forgot... I forgot...
Are you kidding me?  Are you kidding me, that's who you're worried about?  You're... you're worried about the cop's time?  You think I framed you, and you're worried about the taxpayer?  Dah, God! Welcome back, jerky jerk-face.
Since when is it illegal to put caprese salad... anywhere. T
You must feel pretty good about yourself right now.
Are you kidding me?  That's my salad.
Yes, it's mine.Police Officer 2: Some basil.  Salad dressing, I think.Police Officer 1: Salad dressing?Police Officer 2: Yeah it's, uh, a caprese salad.  There's a little bit of, uh, mozerella right there.
Ahh, that's mine.
God! No, that's not... I don't know what that is.  And I... I bet he has nothing to do with that!Police Officer 1: Do you have any weapons?
No, no no no no.Police Officer 1: Turn around.
No, that was... that was legitimate.  That was totally legitimate.Police Officer 1: Really?Police Officer 2: Check this out.
No, no no no... No, no.
Yeah, let's just cancel this, okay?Police Officer 1: Sir, did you recently return from a trip to Central America?
Uh, you know what?  I think that this... uh, this is probably a misunderstanding.
I think you're great.  You're my best friend.
Do you want to hear a lie?
Yes, you did.  And then you came back, which makes you the biggest liar of... history.
Okay, break it down in terms of, um... okay, I-I think I'm getting you...
So the dollar's a surplus. This is a surplus.
I'll be six.
Why don't you explain this to me like I'm five.
There's the x-ax...icks.
Yes. Yes, I can see... that we did indeed. Why don't you explain this to me like I am an eight-year old.
You are the silent killer. Go back to the annex.
Alright, so, teams forming.
Okay. Okay, good suggestions. All good suggestions. Uh, let's just decide and agree upon one.
So... we all agree to get new chairs then. Good?
No, a new copier!  Unless everybody can agree on something better?
Wow, okay. Well... I swallowed all your ideas, I'm going to digest them and see what comes out the other end.
I have no idea.
All right! Cool!
Best lunch ever! Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Really? Absolutely! Yeah, that would be amazing.
I don't know. I haven't decided yet.
Oh, is somebody making fun of me?
Sits on a copier.
Yes they were.
Look at that.  Unh. Unh-unh.
Look at the ass. Check out the ass.
Nine dollars. The boys' department.
You think that's good? Check out these pants. Nine dollars.
Um, no, not... no. No, I got it at TJ Maxx, four dollars.
Oh, thank you.
it was fun. We had a good time.
Oh... ah, I almost choked.
Hey hey! Yeah! Unh!
Hello! Good to see you! Good to see you.
There he is! Hello, hello!
Oh, well, chivalry is not dead after all. Okay...
Oh, thank you my dear.
All right, get out. Get out.
Well, what should I do?
All right, yes.
So, the copier.
Now everyone, bear in mind once again that whatever Hank says goes. He is an impartial third party.
Oh, there we go.
It is, yes.
Oh, okay. Good. Good. Well, here's the thing. Some people want to use the surplus to buy a new copier. Other people are complaining about the chairs.
Okay. Well, we have a surplus. Imagine that your parents give you money for a lemonade stand-
Yes. I need your sage advice. And everyone, whatever Hank decides, that is the decision. That will resolve this issue.  Yeah, take as many as you want.
Hank, thank God you're here. The office is at a crossroads.
...Like a tip?  $645?!
The what now?
No, no, no. I want you to make the decision so I'm not the bad guy.
Mm. I'm calling because, um, we have a stupid budget surplus, and people-everybody wants something different.
No, no, no, no, no. No. I'm calling-  I'm sorry.
Hey David-  I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm eating tiramisu. Some of the chocolate powder just went down my throat. I'm stopping now.
To be continued!
This is so, so stupid. And, God...  that's my phone.
This is so stupid.
I don't need $645; I already have $645, more or less.
Because that is how my mind works.
Do I know what?
Pam, would you stand up for a sec?  Gah! They don't even have paper. And we are spoiled because we throw out perfectly good tiramisu because it has a little tiny hair on it. My point I t
I have made my decision. We do not need a new copier. We do not need new chairs. This copier... is...  working perfectly.
All right, attention everyone.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you guys deal with it? I am going to get up, and I am going to be out in the common area. But you need to decide; otherwise I'm taking the bonus. All right?
You think it's easy?
Good work. I'm proud of you.  Mother-
Awesome.  I think this is going to be the best Christmas party ever.
Cool.  My horn can pierce the sky.
Oh, hey, is that Princess Unicorn?  I thought they were all sold out.
Alright... One more time around the block.
That is vodka and I mixed it with orange juice.  I call it an orange-vod-juice...ka.
Hey, shut up. Here we go. Everybody gather up.
What if we can't do it quickly? What if we cant do it--
We'll do it quickly.
Why don't we just do it now? We'll do it quickly.
No, no. I celebrate privately.
Can not do it then. Monthly dental appointment, soft t
The aye's have it.
Yeah, obviously you are. Okay, everybody who thinks that Meredith is an alcoholic please raise your hand.
I am not asking her to stop drinking.  I am imploring her to quit being an alcoholic.
Okay, you know what I thought we should do is have a quick intervention and then get back to the party.
Okay, no, that's not what we're going for.  Who has a problem with Meredith's drinking?  It has to bother you.  It bothers me. Right? How does it bother you?  Dwight, don't you have anything?
That's-- you didn't-- you weren't hurt by that.
Alcohol is a drag. Yes.  Here's what I'd like to do.  I'd like to go around the room and have us each express to Meredith how her alcoholism has affected us.  I'll begin.  This Christmas party is perhaps the best Christmas party I have ever been to, but then you got so drunk that we had to stop and do this.  That's how your drinking affected me.  Anybody else?  Another time when Meredith's drinking affected you?   Come on people.  If we don't say anything she's not going to get any better.   Yes, Kevin.
Okay, you know what Toby?  One of my employees is undergoing a crisis and I wish for just once you would take my side on this.  I'm doing your job man.  Hey, are you texting?
I got it on a website, that's not important.
Have you ever under the influence of alcohol questioned the teachings of the Mormon church?
Do you sometimes have a drink to celebrate a special occasion or mark a holiday?
You can say it as loudly as you want, but we're not going to believe you.
Was John Belushi fine?  Was Bob Hope fine?  Hey-- come here.  If anything ever happened to you, I would be very angry at myself for not doing all that I could do.
Alright, no, no, no.  No. That is the image, I think we can all agree is very disgusting.  But you know what, Meredith, you lit your hair on fire today.  What about tomorrow.?  What is going to happen when you come into work and you're dead?
Enabler!  Enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler, enabler.  It's Christmas and we are turning our back on somebody who is asking for help.
We're party girls.
Yeah, oh there you go.
It-- yep, recently.
I have a new place.
We could go there, sure.
Oh, shoot.  Oh well, we'll have to go someplace else then I guess.
So do I sign?
I have a deposit.  Alcoholic. M
Let's start meeting-- Hello. How are you?
Here's the door. Here's the door.
Come on. Shh...
Meredith, we are doing this for your own good.  Okay. Come on--
It's okay. It's all right.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, okay! Twelve miles an hour. Eat that, Carl Lewis!
Go, Oscar. Thirty-one's my number.
I was ahead of the car. Thirty-one is my new number.
I want another try. Here we go!  Thirty-one! Thirty-one!
Dwight, there was wind. I want a do-over.
No. No, no. There was wind.
No, that's not it.
No, what I'm saying is...
What are you doing?
You still don't know.
Wait, you still don't know...
Did you ever have intercourse in this office?
Who should it come from, then?
I am telling Andy.
I can't take it anymore.
We have to put an end to this.
You know this can't go on.
Walk with me.
Jim, this has to get out, so we can all deal with it.
Okay, what does that mean?
I am already walking.
It's too late.
How so, specifically?
Is she crazy in bed?
When will she be ready?
All right. See you later.  Ahh.
Okay. I will... Dwight and Angela are having an affair, so...
Which will be fine. I am off!
Well... no, I'm not. So I... I'm not very articulate today, so I'll just leave it for another time. Another day.
David, here it is. My philosophy is basically this. And this is something that I live by. And I always have. And I always will. Don't ever, for any reason, do anything to anyone, for any reason, ever, no matter what. No matter... where. Or who, or who you are with, or, or where you are going, or... or where you've been... ever. For any reason, whatsoever.
Hey, what say we order up some pasta?
I have to say, I am so impressed with the potential you see in me.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, well, then, email it to me.
Fax, why don't you just send it over on a dinosaur?
Oh, have you not?
Hi, I am well, how are you?
You will have pancakes and you'll like it.
You know what? I don't want to get into this debate again. I enjoy IHOP.
Oh, don't start, D
No, no, I never said Denny's. IHOP.
Alright, I am a local business owner.  I need to buy paper.  I find out everything about their prices and p
No, I got it.
No, I will seduce her.
I will seduce her.
Good. Here come the sharks.
Argh, why are you all...
And there are clouds. There are clouds in the sky, which means gonna rain, bad for business.
Mm hmm .
Ah ha  Yup. D
They could be shrinking.
Maybe they are shrinking.
Oh Vietnam, I hear it's lovely .Prince G
Ah, so when did you set up shop?Prince G
Really? That many? This doesn't seem like a very big operation.Prince G
You know, I will be honest with you... about something. Where we used to live, our paper supplier had a lot of big clients and I just didn't feel like a priority. So I guess my question  how many clients do you have?Prince G
We are a law firm.Prince G
My name is Michael Scarn. I am a local business owner and I would like to find out about your company.Prince G
Yes, well about some things, and other things I am very stupid. Like, watch this. Is this the cup?  Laughter is my job, tears are my game, law is my profession. D
Why is this little 2 so small? It's, it's weird, you don't, you just go by the x. The x means times. 4 times x 2. What is double 4?Prince G
What's going on?  Little homework over here? Lets see if I can help. Huh, math, that's not so hard. Ok. There are 4 of these, ignore the parenthesis, right?Prince G
I would, could you just stand over here? That would be great
Don't blow it. Hey Linda, can I get a picture of you?
Hey, hey, how is your interview going?
Oh God, what was that?
He's going to absolutely freak.
Wallace is going to freak.
Of course. Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.
I... Okay, okay, okay,
No, no, really not necessary.
Just, shut up. You know we are just going to call a tow truck, so...Prince G
No no, we are fine. You have done enough already.
Aw, it's alright.
Ok, goodbye Prince Family.
Thank you.Prince G
Oh coffee, that's too much.
You know let me give you some money for this. Prince S
That is true. We have gone down the wrong path many many times.
That is true.
My heart says...
I'm not going to make this call.
It's from James Bond.
Why don't we just, live and let live?
Ok. You know, our sales are fine. We're doing fine. They're doing fine. D
Dwight, what will happen to that family if I call David and give him this information?
Im not a shark.
Give it, give it. We can't do this to those people. D
Those people will be ruined.
Somewhere safe, where it can't hurt anyone
Just something I have to do first.
You are right. I will call David and give him the customer list and I will give him all my info.
I guess this is what they call a bittersweet moment. It is bitter because I slightly destroyed a wonderful little family. But sweet because David Wallace thought I did a good job. That's what I hate bittersweet chocolate. I don't even... what's the point of that? Why not just sweet? Who are you helping?
Okay, bye bye. D
Leave me al--
Open your mouth.  Come on. Don't swallow it.
No, no, no! You will not die! Stanley! Stanley! You will not die!  Stanley! Stanley! Barack is president!  You are black, Stanley! I'm gonna give him mouth to mouth.
Okay, we're trapped.  Everyone for himself.
Get out of the way! Go, go, go!
What does warm mean?
Everyone, now  calm down!
Oh my God! Okay, it happening.  Everybody stay calm. D
You talking to me?David W
Do you?David W
And we should take a part of his pay and donate it the charity of your choice.  Something that Dwight doesn't like. D
Okay.  This city.  Dwight. We are not mad, we are just disappointed. David W
Take heed of.
Take heed of. D
No, I will.
I'm a smart guy.  I'll figure it out.
No, Dwight.  I am worried.  A man's life is in my hands.
Shut it.  Shut it.
Uh-uh.  No, no, no.  Come on. Get up.  Let's do this.
And you're okay with that?
No rest for the sick. We are not always going to be there to coddle your heart back when it disappears to be working.  What are you gonna do if you're by yourself and your heart stops?
You know who I really think should go? Stanley.
Ah, Ah, Ah, Ah... A
Okay, I got it.
Yes, yes I do.  I love that song.  First I was afraid, I was petrified.
I will divide and then count to it.
Where are they?  You know what? If we come across somebody with no arms or legs do we bother resuscitating them? I mean, what kind of quality of life do we have there?
Okay, okay.  I'll show them. Here we go.  Stanley.  All right.  CPR T
This is you we're talking about.
Okay, look. David, this is why we have training.  We start with the dummy, and we learn from our mistakes. And now Dwight knows not to cut the face off of a real person.
Let's hear it.
Ok... I think that thing is on the fritz. Ahh... Oscar, would you reach over and touch his thing? That's what HE said! Right guys, 'cause of gay?  Let's give this a shot.
Let me getcha.
No no, I'll help you. I'll help you up. Here we go.
You have stress?
Oh, ok. What is that, like, a video game?
Racism is dead Stanley, you can have any kind of ice cream you want. What do you want?  What is that? People! Please I told you to get rid of the cell phones.
Remember when people used to say boss, when they were describing something that was really cool like, those shoulder pads are really boss man... Look at that perm, that perm is so boss. It's what made me want to become a boss. And I looked so good in a perm and shoulder pads. But now, boss is just slang for jerk in charge.
It's not! It's not offensive during a roast! Anything goes! I want you guys to really get crackin on this. I want you to take me down. Don't hold back. I want you to really make fun of anything about me. It could be my race, could be the fact that I'm so fit, or I'm a womanizer... fair game. Whatever. I don't want to write your stuff for you, but I just want it to be good.
What? No. No, I am talking about a roast! Of Michael Scott! Oh c'mon! Who here has the Comedy Central Roast channel? You've seen it right? Everybody gets together, and everyone starts hurling insults at the one guy, and everybody's laughing, and everybody's hugging each other... O
Whoo!! Welcome welcome welcome welcome welcome. You are all jerks. Just kidding, not yet anyway. Welcome to the roast of Mr. Michael Scott. If you're here for the Grabowski wedding, it is the second door on the left.  Ok... lower the mic for the midget.
Hey Hey, I don't go make burgers where you work and then tell you how to make burgers. Ha ha!
You're so lucky! Good one...
Pow pow pow...
Spite her - ok  J
I know where this is goin'.
Idiot. Idiot! Idiot. Idiot.
That is the way you're supposed to do it, idiot.
Dwight your'e supposed to do it this way.
No no no no no no!
Can I make just a little announcement. In a professional roast, usually the roaster will say something nice about the roastee after they're done, something about how much they love them, so, just, keep that in mind.
Hey, ya know what? Forgive me for caring. Right?
I don't believe I have had the pleasure.Warehouse M
Uhh... hehe hah! I'm thinking Roy?
Oh very funny.
We are, we are a family. D
Haha ha. Thank you very much, thank you. That was great. Great job, great laughs. Really, really went after my intelligence there.
Andy, Cornell called, they think you suck. And you're gayer than Oscar. Boom. Roasted.
Well I wrote them down so I wouldn't forget. Jim, you're 6'11 and you weigh 90 pounds, Gumby has a better body than you. Boom. Roasted. Dwight, you're a kiss ass. Boom. Roasted. Pam, you failed art school. Boom. Roasted. Meredith, you've slept with so many guys you're starting to look like one. Boom. Roasted. Kevin, I can't decide between a fat joke and a dumb joke. Boom. Roasted. Creed, you're teeth called, your breath stinks. Boom. Roasted. Angela where's Angela?  Oscar, you're gay.
I um, I spent the afternoon in the park trying to feed the pigeons, I guess they all flew west for the winter, and I, I just had some thoughts that I wanted to share with you people.
Would you like fries with that? Please drive around.
You find it?
You, and at six foot six, from the University of North Carolina, Jiiiiim Halpeeeeert.
because they are yellow and they're wet with your urine.
Could I stick it with a pin?
Yes Michael Scott for Dr. Jocelyn, please. Hello doctor I was just following up on my mole again. No, I was looking online about sebaceous cysts. I have not been squeezing it.
You ready? And we're off, like a herd of turtles.
No. Oh, all right.
...kind of  Maybe you could tie it around your waist or lose the shirt underneath or something.
Hey! Look at what you're wearing again, Pam. Have you ever seen a magician's assistant?  That's...
Well that goes without saying.
Yeah, oh don't say bucks, it's not lady like. Here we go!  Okay so what we do is drive all day and we stay in hotels together at night.
No! That is a toboggan, you never know when you're gonna find a snowy hill so... Every magician has a hot assistant, and every rock star has a roadie, and Pam is my hot roadie.
Is that why your wearing makeup today?
You nervous about seeing Karen again, since she was the other woman? Actually you were the other woman so...
Well then... hey you know what then let's just talk.
Then listen to your iPod, Pam.
No. I need silence or Sam Kinison to prepare.
Okay, Mm Hmm. Ten, ten months?
Okay. Wow. Oh man! My head just exploded. Whoo! Thank God, for everybody right? Whoo kay. Wow, you're huge! That's incredible! I... God sorry, sorry my head is... I'm just, I'm trying to figure out the last time that you and Jim had sex, and...
That's what I do, steal my trick.
Okay, don't be nervous, just picture her naked.
Rolando,  I'd like you to meet Pam. She is our receptionist. You know what? Maybe you guys could go out on a little friend date sometime.
Would a liar bring mini Mounds bars?
I am talking about, how you all need to sell an experience. Like I sold you on the idea that my father had died.
She is pregnant. She is knocked up. "K" Karen. Pam, let's go.
Oh, I still have more.
Well, then it will be easier for you. But I, I still think it's worthwhile, to give a, give it a try.
But it works. I would like you all to give this a shot. What do you say?
Got it. It works.
Old hatreds dissolve into new friendships. It's a really wonderful moment.
No, it's really dorky. You were right the first time.
It's really amazing. Congratulations Karen. So is there a guy or, uh, a person. Or, uh, a sperm machine that did this to you, or?
Email's not scary. This is an opportunity. Don't, don't blow it.
No, don't worry, the chain is off.
Really? No, honestly. Tell me what you really think.
I'll just blow off the lecture at Rochester.
She was the love of my life. What you and Jim have times 100. Just she... she just left. And I didn't... I never got closure, you know? I never got closure with her. I haven't talked to her since. I haven't seen her since. And I feel like I need to go to Nashua and get closure. I feel like I need that.
Blonde hair, nice boobs. Not too big, not too small.
No.  I'm just thinking about what you said, about Karen, about closure. You remember Holly? She used to work for H.R.?
Oh- She's not here?
Yes, you can. I am, uh, Michael Scott, Regional Manager of the Scranton branch.
I can do this.
And then she'll move back to Scranton. And her boyfriend will die.
I know, just... uh, please, I'm going through something, okay?
I can't do the presentation, I can't-
How could she do this to me, Pam?
No, no, I'm okay. I'm all right.  Okay... okay.
Yeah, yeah... uh, I can't do this Pam. Just read from- just read the cards. P
Does it feel good?A.J.: Does what feel good?
It's all connected. Shut up.  Does she ever mention 'Michael Scott?'A.J.: No, what are you talking about?
Yep, we will get to you. Okay, so you're dating somebody? Um... is it serious?A.J.: It's pretty serious, yes.
Ooh. Ouch. Okay, good. You're funny, very good and funny. Tell me, A.J., are you dating? Is there somebody you date?A.J.: Yeah. Why, are you interested?
What do you race cars?A.J.:  I'm a salesman. That's why I raised my hand.
A.J. What kind of name is A.J.?A.J.:
No, you don't have to do that. P
No, that wouldn't-
I know, I know. You're right, you're right.
No, sh- she didn't. I'm gonna read it.
I shouldn't have done it. It just- I couldn't help it.
I also stole something off of her computer. A document called "Dear Michael."
I stole a sleeve of her sweater.
I went through Holly's things.
She said that? Is that what it said? What did it say?
Man, was he fat. So, so... fat. You know what, forget it. I know me. When I saw him, I would never be able to apologize to him. Too fat. Big fat fatty.
Jabba the hut, Pizza the hut, Fat guys like pizza, pepperoni pizza, pepperoni Tony!
Who have I wronged? Who have I wronged? Oh, oh! What about that fat guy from Stamford that I insulted? We should find him!
That was funny.  Let's go do it to somebody else.   Ayyyy!
What was that?
Hello, may I help you?
Yeah, I hear ya.   It's been four months since I was with Holly, and she was way hotter then Stacy.  So if you think you're hurting...
So we may not have someone in our lives that we love, but we do have each other.
So suck it.   Hey everybody, I just invited Jim to suck it, and I am cordially inviting all of you to a special convention, a lonely heart's convention, this afternoon. Singles only.
--then, we, are gonna have our own private Valentine's Day party.
--that none of us can be a part of--
Well, if you guys insist on having your own private little love fest--
Yeah.  And the sexy looks between you and Pam, the general sexiness, the flowers, it's creating a bit of a hostile work environment.
Yes, um, Jim.  Today is a very difficult day for a lot of people in this office.
Can I have a word with you, Jim?
Type O-Ocean Spray.Blood G
Yup, I'm good, whew.  Wow, I feel like a human juicebox.  Hawaiian blood punch.Blood G
Oh, God. Blood Drive W
Okay, here we go.Blood Drive W
You're actually talking a lot.Blood G
Yeah, can I point something out to you?  Blood G
Oh, well, that's fine.Blood G
Yeah, me too.Blood G
Oh, OK.Blood G
Okay.  Hello.Blood G
Whew, wow I was so nervous about this I don't think I ate for three days. Blood G
What?Blood Drive W
That is full of soup.Blood G
A hat.Blood G
That was mean.Blood G
Could you distract me for a second, just talk about things that don't have blood in them?Blood G
I looked straight at the bag.Blood G
I looked at the bag.Blood G
OK.  Oh, wait a second, wait a second, that's hers.   This is hers, she left her glove.  I need her name if I'm gonna return her glove.Blood Drive W
Excuse me, waitress, where did the lady go?Blood Drive W
If you wanna just, anything? Are you sure?  I'm sure whatever you did it wasn't your fault.  OK well, who else?
Come on, I'm sure there's something you need to get off your chest.
Yeah, but now his heart is in Thailand along with the rest of his body having random sex.   Okay, sorry, let's, who else?  Oscar.
-- I don't think it is.
Old fashioned meet market --
I was thinking maybe like a mixer.
No.  Not a giant net.
No, no, no, no.  I mean have this kind of party. I look around and I see all these beautiful people who are alone on Valentine's, and I think that there are other single people out there too.  We just need to find them.  There's a girl out there for all of us maybe even in this office park.  There has to be a way to get all these lonely people together.
You know what guys? I don't think we need to do this.
Alright who's next?  Where's Andy?
Well then it's a happy ending, because he was gay. You should call him!
Oh my God.
Moron, if he was there wouldn't be a story.
Yeah, OK.  Well, he only gets better.
Where you from?
Lynn, follow me, come on in.  For you we have one of our top people Kevin Malone.  Kevin, come out here show your beautiful self.
Babe alert!   Hello, I'm Michael Scott, welcome to our little shindig.
Oh, here we go.
Meh, exactly.  Eh.
No.  No, I meant about being single today.
So how you holding up? D
Ah, still early. D
Meredith recently had a total hysterectomy, so that's sort of a repair.  Alright, I'll let you guys talk.
Believe me its nothing.  I hardly even talked to her we just, we were lying there next to each other, I think our blood bags touched.
It's not a big deal really, I just, you know met somebody, we hardly talked, I picked up her glove so I was hoping I could give it back to her.
Nobody's after me, I just, I met a woman when I was giving blood and I thought she might come by.
Nah. [everyone groans and Girl turns around and walks away.
Hey, you don't deserve her.
You know what, you guys, you guys can get out I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
Really?   Oh, thanks.
I'm not gonna answer it D
Dwight, get the door. D
Who's there? J
You, you like that?  D
What the hell was that?
I know you are. Knock, knock.
No, no, no. They are not just ordinary jelly beans little girl. These are extraordinary jelly beans!
Why thank you very much.  Oh, what are those? What are those? Tell me, please!
Oh, no, no, no, no. I am not Michael. I am Willy Wonkaaaaa. P
No. Jim. We're a business. Post-its. That is a golden ticket idea. NASA took five or six golden ticket ideas to get man on the moon. A
Too many words. Good ideas are simple. 'Golden ticket.'
Woo hoo. J
You didn't, but... it'll be fine. It'll be good.
Well no harm no foul.
That is not constructive.
OK, we need a gold ticket idea to get us out of this mess.  Yes.
Well you know what Jim? It is not my fault that you bought a house to impress Pam. That is why carnations exist.
Alright, then we're screwed. I am just a net that traps all of your crappy subconscious ideas and adds a little bit of my own childhood memories and whimsy, so - J
No, they can't. O
You're breaking up.
How are you doing? D
Yes, you did.
Yes I do. You've just never seen it.  March 4th. Dwight came up with the best idea today about golden tickets. D
Umm, nacho chips.  D
It's not ready yet.
You kind of have. D
That's why you made the decision. That's why you made... D
That's it. That's it. You can't put a price on freedom. D
Could I be a part of the meeting also?
Really? How did-- how are you inspired?  How did it pop into your head Dwight?
Hey, Dwight, great idea. Dwight, Dwight, great idea. How'd you come up with that idea? D
...that is more absorbent, and softer than toilet paper. I have a lot of toilet ideas. D
Toilet sponge. It's a hollowed out sponge...
You are? Good ideas, huh? Hey, did you come up with toilet buddy? It's a net, circular net, that you put inside the toilet to catch all of your change and your wallet from falling into the toilet? Formally known as toilet guard? D
Oh how dare you. D
OK, here's what happened, David. It was all my idea. You called me and you were really angry at me and I got scared, so I had Dwight take the fall, but now, it turns out that it's a great idea and Dwight will not confess. Can you believe that? D
There is no movie called Willy Wonka. It's called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
I want to see it.
And classy, yeah.
I think you're right. This party has to have all the excitement, drama and intrigue of my time here.
Not classy at all.
That's what makes him classy.
You know, that's good but it's not classy. I-I need something classy like the opening of a car dealership.
You look dynamite. What are you talking about? Very slick. Ok, get the fish.
What? No, I didn't want to make everybody nervous.
Wow! Hold that thought. I want everybody to go into the break room. I have a little surprise for you. Go ahead. You too. Dwight, would you escort our guest in there? C'mon, here we go, don't be shy, don't be shy, you're one of us .  Dwight, stall him a little, I have to get the fish.
Uh-huh.  Here he is.
Miner? I hardly know her!... Hello?
Surprise, there is nothing in here. The real surprise is in the conference room. Let's go!  Oh! God! Ok, come on, come on!
Took me all night.
Oh no, no, no. You don't have to do that. I've got this covered. This was just a meet-and-greet. C
Such as salary, benefits, etc, etc. Insurance.
Well, it's not official.
Charles is going to tell you.
Well, why don't-
Well, due to the economy, there is a lot of worry going around. I didn't want to worry people.
No. Absolutely not.
Above and beyond.
Good. Good, good, good. Everyone, please give it up for Charles Miner.
Well, perfect, because we have now arrived at Kevin and he has no sexual history. K
There you go! Where's the other?
This little hell-raiser is Angela. She has slept with a bunch of different guys in the office. One over there, in the orange
This is Oscar Martinez. He is Latino. And he just got out of a long-term relationship with a man, Gil, who broke his heart. But he didn't bring any of that into work, it did not affect his job performance whatsoever and I am very proud of him for that. C
Oh, nerd alert! K
Oh, ok. If we hire Cirque de Soleil as salaried employees, will that help us with year-end tax stuff?
Oh, right. David, are you coming to my fifteenth anniversary party? D
Listen, why don't we just leave that position vacant? Truth be told, I think I thrive under a lack of accountability. D
It was my understanding. D
Ok, alright, well I'll just bounce that off David, see what comes back.
And that- I-I don't need to be managed, Charles. And if you want pick up some tips, observing here, and take them to the other branches, it's all good. But Jan would mostly come by when she was super horny, and Ryan would come by to visit his parents and do laundry, so... Are we clear?
Does David know this?
You're not from paper?
Beautiful. See, African-Americans have such a rich history of unusual names. C
I was never given a name.
And I really really need to talk to David.
Hi Stephanie, it's Michael Scott again. I just spoke with Michael Scotch and the son's going to be returned, everything's fine. S
No! You idiot!  S
For breakfast. Except Charles. You say no more parties, and then you spend all of this money on lunch, I think it's a little hypercritical. C
Nobody thanked me.
I wish you had told us sooner, because I was going to go to the vending machine and get an egg salad.
Are you kidding me with this? On the day that I bring in breakfast?
How old are you?
Ok, so we're on the same page, great.
Yes it is!
Kevin? This is my branch. You don't ask Charles. You ask me. I say, approved.
Do some overtime? You want to do some overtime this weekend? You know what, Kevin, I applaud your initiative. Yes. You may.
I'm kidding around, wow! Relax, everybody, it's just a joke. It's fine. Boy, so touchy. PPC, let's continue our morning meeting in the conference room.
I'm gonna walk away.
Five years old?
Ok, no, no, no, no. No. You know what? I'm going to New York. And I am going to talk to David Wallace.
Yeah, here we go. Ok.
Yeah, why don't you do that? C
Whoa. You're talking about my anniversary party, so. . .
But it's cool, and it's-
Really? Well then how would we come up with great ideas like Jim's? Go ahead.
Party Planning Committee. Not your concern, Charles.
I've put having a family on hold. D
Fifteen years I have been here. And I have sacrificed a lot. D
Clearly that's what you wanted. D
Ok. Then I don't get it. It doesn't make any sense to me. Because I thought in the new system I was supposed to talk to Charles, and then Charles was supposed to talk to you, and that would dilute any need for me to ever talk to you again.
Do you talk to him about this? You've talked to him all day, obviously. Did you talk to him about this?
You have no idea how high I can fly.
No, No! I was so nervous it was the wrong building! I walked into the wrong building!
Okay, so.  I get up to the building, I get to the revolving door... broken!  So I have to take the normal door.  O
You guys have thought about this a lot more than I have. I just winged it.
Why would I do that?
I looked at Wallace and I said "I quit!" and as I turned to leave I looked back and I said "You have no idea how high I can fly."
Scotch with Splenda. Tastes like Splenda, gets you drunk like scotch.  Clinky, clinky-clink.  Come-on... come on, come on.
You're 'I need you to' is my command.
Any good headhunter knows I am available.
Pam, what you don't understand is that at my level you just don't look in the want-ads for a job.  You are head-hunted.  J
I have a job.
Me too, me too. Is this wine?
Oh! Hey. What is this about?
You can talk to me for as long as you want. I have all the time in the world.  Oh God! Blech! Phyllis! A
Yes I am.
That's a drive!
No I'm staying.
Hey hey... what's up Chuck?
Oh, agreed, mmm, except...
Alright, Michael Scott Paper Company. You want in? Do you want to be a part of this? J
Right, I know paper, I know how to manage. I have a name, close your eyes.  J
Yeah! Oh God. I practically invented decline.
Can you believe... cause I know paper.  I know everything there is to know about paper.
Can't I take some paper and just tape over it with transparent tape?
You... oh.  Somebody has been talking in bed.  Pillow talk.
So think about it.  Lets put a pin in it for now.
It's... it's very courageous, very exciting. Um...
Can you believe it? Well, we'll see, we'll see. It's just a, just a nugget of an idea right now s
Yeah.  In all climates.  It's going to be worldwide.  And I'm looking for some talented salesmen to join me.  That's where you come in.
Okay, hey, you already have the job.  You don't have to convince me.  O
No, no no.  O
I am offering you the opportunity of a lifetime, Oscar. To come work for me.  O
I made it sterile.
Oh-okay, you're not letting me finish, and you just lost out on a million dollars.
Just... I want you to think about it, I'm starting my own company.
Listen, Listen, Stanley. You don't have to answer me now.
Hank?  You really think Hank is going to be loyal to you?  Hank, please escort Charles from the building.  H
Okay, I have immunity. It's my two-weeks... C
... and I feel free!
Well, okay, lets go. P
Alright, okay.  Deal! Okay, well... Jim?
Right... Executive assistant.
Okay.  It's going to be great.
You're going to mess with me, is that what you're going to do? I'll tell you something Charles, I don't even care. Cause I've got nothing got lose.  Oh my God, OH GOD! No no, all right. Fine, it's not even worth it.  P
I think maybe Hank should be here.
Okay, Okay, we don't have much time.  Just act normal.  Don't look at me people. Stop.  Don't look down. Don't look down. He's going to see me.  Don't look all the way up. Keep it at a normal height.  Okay. This is not Michael Scott talking right now, this is your future.  Hello, I am your future.  You're older, and you are very happy now.  Because you went with Michael Scott.  Right.  So everybody come on down.  Lets just crawl out of here together. Alright?  Come on!  Are you, are you doing your best here?  Are you being the best that you can be?   Alright. Everybody who's going to go with me I want you to stomp your foot.  Okay, alright. Come on. You're coming with me.  Come on Phyllis.  Here we go, here we go!
So which way are you leaning?
No, of course not.  But now I want everybody. Jim!  Jim?  Buddy, Hey!  Buddy, Jimbo?  Did you have time to think about my offer?
Angela Kevin, you have to help me out I just need a few things then I will be gone.
Shh shh shh... don't look down, look straight up. Come on please!
That is inappropriate, Pam. Come on in.
Yes I was. Yes I was.
Oh, good. My hooker's here.  Hi.
Thank you. Would you like some french toast?
I can't do this! This is pathetic, isn't it? I am such an idiot. I gave up the only job I ever loved to do this? I have egg in my Crocs.
Let go, please. Just gimmee - P
Just let go. P
No, I'm whipping them.
You excited? About the new company?
So how you feeling about the new company?
Yeah, I guess it's not so bad. Got a few things cookin'.  Umm...
Maybe. Barbara Keebis. She invests in local businesses. And I am putting together a little presentation for her.
He worked at that telemarketing place.
He's everything I'm not and everything I am. He's the whole package.
Assemble a sales team. A dream team.
It's totally impossible!
I'm not getting dressed. I'm not getting dressed. I have too many things to do before I get dressed. I need to find a hundred clients.
Don't patronize me, Pam.
We can do this.
No! No No. No. "My Stumps." Like "My Humps" but a guy with no legs. P
Okay. Okay. "Achey Breaky Fart."
How are we gonna find an office? How can we pay for an office?
Yes we do. So, get excited. But I have to go the bathroom real quick. If you'll excuse me, be right back.  Ah, okay.
Okay, imagine a company that has no memory of your past misconduct because they have no files.
He's already paying for himself.
He's stealing them. Okay, okay.
Look what he's doing.
Would you like to come to work for the Michael Scott Paper Company?
Pam. Everyone deserves a second second chance.  Ryan, just out of curiosity, how much do you get paid here?
Yes, it is.
Excuse me. Yes?
Mmmm-My mission is stated as f
By wanting it more. By working hard- N
Okay. I have spent the last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the paper industry. With a lean, mean fighting crew and low overhead, I think I can perform the same business at a much, much higher rate of profit.
Well... this might not be the right time, but I need more than I originally asked for. N
Well what is it exactly? I mean, what, what specifically? We don't - it doesn't have to be paper. We could sell medicine and other...
Nana.  I really think that Papa would want you to do this.
So what are our options? Well, we can start this paper company. We can try. Or... that's it. That's our only option. Because we quit. Pam, I do my best work when people don't believe in me. I remember in high school, my math teacher told me I was gonna flunk out. And know what I did? The very next day I went out and I scored more goals than anyone else in the history of the hockey team. See what I mean? I thrive on this. I thrive on it. So I'm gonna go inside. I'm going to make some calls, I'm gonna get us an office space, and I'm going to show you why you joined this company. Okay?
I want you to listen to me. Because I want to tell you the situation that we are both in right now, kay? You quit your job. I quit my job. We both quit. Those are the facts. That's what happened. Now, what are our choices right now? Because you know, kiddo, you quit.
Well we  should make a list. Lists are good. Lists are good. Lists are good. First on the list, let's get you out of the car. Alright.  Okay...
Well you know what? My mom always used to say that average people are the most special people in the world. And that's why God made so many.
Yeah. I have cable and satellite as a backup.  Yeah, I know. Two not-so-great things in a row. Ehhhh, well. Stuff happens, right? At least we got Ryan. The Rye-guy. We should call him Rye bread. We don't have to call him that. Unless you like it. We could call him that. P
Yeah, I'm good. You good?
Except this time, you have no legal right to kick me out, because I have started my very own paper company right here in the building. If I were you, Charles Miner, I would watch your step. Because the Michael Scott Paper Company is about to open a big ol' can of whoopass on Dunder Mifflin.  Actually a six pack. We're gonna open a six pack of whoopass. He looks scared.
Yes, I am, Charles.
Hello! They took away my parking space but they can't take away my pride!
We wait, and hope that people show up to the pancake luncheon.
Just make that copy okay?
Would someone just make the copy?
Listen. Listen listen listen listen listen listen. I need someone to make a copy of this. Because I don't make copies, I'm the boss. Got it? I make originals.
I'm on the phone, please. Mom, I'm gonna have to call you back. P's being a giant B.
They're getting on my nerves Mom. Both of them. R thinks he's too good to be here, and P is not as much fun without Jim.
No, you're supposed to say, "Rock the house."
Okay guys, thank you for the offers. But I want you to get pumped about this corner idea. All right?  1,2,3- What are we gonna do?
Okay. There are ... 4 corners in this room. Each corner is to be a personal space for each one of you. Whichever corner you want. And make it your own.
Pam, I don't make the rules.
No, this is where I work. I can't relax in the same corner where I work.
Thank you. You remember Ryan  And Pam is around here somewhere.
Well, at least you're still being honest with me.
You sorta disappeared there for a while. Where ya been?
Ryan, enough with the texting machine. Come on. And tuck in your shirt, you're the face of this company.
These are shaped like paper.
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
She did it!
Oh yeah! R
You did! P
Just say the word.
Give him a guarantee.
Don't tell them we have free delivery!
That was four years ago. Why don't you let it go?
Yes, I do.
No, no, listen, as a friend, I want you to have this.
It's for your trouble.
I really appreciate it.
Oh. Okay. Ed's Tires, huh?
Is this good?
Bring it in. Morning cheer. Michael, Pam & R
Good, you take the lead on this one. Also, do not forget that he has just gone through a messy divorce.
That is smart. That would not seem genuine. Ryan?
Is it Stanley?
Is the cool new guy Charles?
Good. Will you meet me in 20 minutes at the spot?
So I would say that the old boss has always been good to Dwight, and he was there first, so he has dibs. You respect dibs, don't you?
Someone could say that it is like the situation that we are in now?
Dwight, are you talking about us?
Can I use it?
Crystal clear. So is this for a movie that you're writing? D
Personal hero, cool new guy. Okay, I think I'm getting your drift. D
Oh n- Is it Mose? Did you put the cover on that well?
I. Understand. Nothing.
Mm-do... Dwight would not-
Just-what's going on?
You be cool.
Oh my God! Run! Run! It's a setup. Setup! C
I got hit in the face with a pee-filled water balloon, Pam, ok? I don't know how they did it. They filled the balloon with pee. A funnel? I don't know. Is that clear enough for you?
It's like, a girl says she'll make out with you, but then her boyfriend is waiting around the corner with a pee-filled balloon. P
It was a setup. Dwight told Charles. He told him.
Yes, and hear me, Dwight, when I say I brought you into this world, and I can take you out.  Bill Cosby.
I'm just getting hardcore with him.
I want you to listen to me, friend, and I want you to listen to me good. I am going to come at you, and I am going to come at you hard. I am going to steal all of your clients, and then I am going to kill them in front of you.
Wow. High score?
You have two seconds.
Toward the sun.
Meet- Ok, go to the spot and then walk 100 feet.
So you heard Schofield is considering a switch, and you want mercy?
I do too.
So you just rat me out? You could have said no.
I hope you're not recording this conversation.  Good. I cannot believe that you sided with Charles.
Really? That's weird. We didn't see any.
Be that as it may, I have your meatball parm sandwich here, and I am going to eat it.
What about our truce?
No, Dwight, we were robbed. How would you even know? You're still stuck in traffic.  You?
Dwight, not now, we've been robbed.
Mr. Schofield, good to see you. And I'm closing the door.
Walking in the door...Mr. S
Oh, great. Mr. Schofield's ready to see me. Thank you so much.
You can hear me, but I can't hear you.
Oh, uh oh, I'm turning you down right now.
Oh, one more thing. I'm going to have you listen while I steal your biggest client.
If you keep coming after us, the Michael Scott Paper Company cannot succeed. D
Dwight, do you mind if we talk?
Yes. He does not have the authority to say that. I, on the other hand, am the president, the owner, and the founder. It is like you are buying software from Bill Gates.
Good, good, good. I will see you.
That sounds like a fantastic idea. I will see you this weekend for the Penguins. Box seats as usual.Mr. S
Are going to fall by the wayside. Two of their branches have closed within the last year. The Michael Scott Paper Company, however, has opened a new branch this very month.
I'm going to pull a date out of the air right now. April 13th, 2002. That is the last day that you evaluated your paper needs. Is it not? We all know that the economy is bad, and bloated companies like Dunder Mifflin...
That's very rude.
Hey, hey, hey. Something about that seems inappropriate.
He's undercutting us big time. He's actually taking a loss and paying the difference out of pocket.
That's what I said.
Milk and sugar.
We should look into that.  Or we just go for the loft.
Most do in the magazines.
Like in a dorm room.  You put your desk underneath, you have your loft up top.  You can sleep up top.  P
Oh, you know what you would love? Is if we built a loft.
Okay, okay.  Hold on, hold on.  Ty, I would like you to crunch those numbers again.
Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.Financial G
Explain that.Financial G
Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is.
Lowest in town.Financial G
Okay. A lame attempt at humor.  Swing and a miss.Financial G
No.  There's a lot I haven't done.
I love Pad Thai.
I know.  But I always thought that the day that he died would be the worst day of my life.  I was wrong.  It's this.  P
Yep. Oh... wow.
That's a pun.
Yes, well, we're not only tight-ends, we are also quarterbacks.
No-- We don't have-- J
Jim, what you don't understand is that this company's worthl-- J
Listen, I can't make you laugh right now.  J
Right, right. There is no way in hell that I am going to say that we're broke.
Of course not. R
It is.  I'm good.
Michael Scott Paper Company to see Mr. David Wallace.  I believe we're expected.   Well, well, well. How the turntables...
Are you kidding me?  That is insultingly low.  I don't even want to hear what your first offer was.
And we are prepared to reject that offer.
We are so rich.
Just amongst ourselves.  D
It's a lot of money, okay.  But we need money coming in every week.  We need jobs.  Wouldn't you rather have a fishing pole than a fish?  R
Yes! Can you believe it?  That's what I'm talking about!
Can we have the room please?
Yes, she is.  At the Michael Scott Paper Company in it's heyday.  P
Hold it up.  Conference room, five minutes.
If there is something that you would like to say as a group, then by all means, you may say it to me right now.  A
No, you lost those clients.  A
It's going to work very smoothly, because Pam and Ryan are bringing over a ton of clients from Michael Scott Paper Company and--
Not important.  Okay, alright.  Yes. Yes, you have a job.  Frankly, you have a job because Ryan and Pam are starting with us as salesmen.  D
I will--no, no.  I'll talk to them when they all get back from the bathroom.  J
Michael Scott Paper Company only.  J
Yeah, yeah. The Shield.
Yeah, the Commish.
That was  us, right there.
Mmm.  Thanks for going out, guys.
What'd you have, Stanley?
Yes I do.  A
Hey, hey guys.  You know what I want you to do?  Shake hands, get over it.  That was not a shake, Dwight.  D
Okay, okay, okay.
Are you kidding me?  D
Get 'em there.  Get 'em there.
Whatever you guys did earlier.
You are not reacting at all as I had hoped.  D
Okay.  If I give you your clients back there won't be enough clients for Ryan and Pam, and I promised both of them they were gonna be salespeople.
And Bingo was his name.  Let's go.
Ho-ho, man!  Wow.  Honey!  I want you to bring the garbage out.  'Cause I'm not going to have sex with you unless you bring out the garba--
Okay.  So be it, then you've lost credibility.  And I'm going to go with my guy, and that's Ryan.
I don't think you are being totally impartial though, because you haven't said one bad thing about Pam.
I don't need to tell you that.   J
I like her.  I think that she is a fast learner.  Cons, she doesn't always follow through.  Sh--New York and the whole art school thing.  And Roy.  She has a weird voice.
I like his hair.  J
Pro for Ryan, he went to business school, he's my number one choice.  J
Have a seat.
Could you send her in?  P
Oh! What's our receptionists name?
You should have seen your face.  Oh man! Oh, that was classic.
No, you're the best person for the job.  You're going to be great.  P
I gave Ryan the sales job.  There just weren't enough clients for the two of you.  So I had to--
I don't know, actually.
No, I'm kidding.  No, you're not--you're not fired.  Yet.
Oh, your face!  Oh!
He will be ushering you out.    E
What about the rest of you?
Okay. How about a woman? Pam?
Ugh! God! What happened to you people?  We are just office drones. We are office drones. All we do is work... is work.
I... was just learning... to... love.
I love it.
Ok. I love it. I love it.
You gotta keep yourself dehydrated.
Now you got it. Hey, you want some espresso?
Now you got it.
Come on in. Hey, hey, hey. Here we go. Here we go. Yeah.
If you ever want to come down here, door's always open, lock's broken, so... E
No work. No work. No work. I come in here to release frustration. Ooh. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ooh.
Wha - No. No. Not even close. I can't force you to go down but I can entice you. I'm gonna be down there. Erin will be down there from time to time... and all-you-can-eat espresso.
It's a daytime disco on the ground floor of and industrial office building.
... with coffee but without the haunted.
No. Dwight is confusing you. That - it's, it's more of a disco.
Why don't you get over lunch, Oscar? Everybody else is past it.
I've taken my downstairs office and I have turned it into a place to hang out. A place where unattractive and attractive people can get together. To meet. To greet. To see the ones that you love. To love the ones that you see.
Funk is the problem and the solution.
Daddy's here for you. My wittle angels. Ok. I think that I have figured a way to get you guys out of your funk.
Are you all afwaid?
I am your big daddy and I am gonna kiss da boo boo.
Cookie. Kevin, cookie.
This is a no work zone. Please respect the lei.
Holdin' down the fort.
We're going to take care of you. We're gonna get you help. Let's - come on.
It's her back. We just - We need - Let's - You know what?
No. No. No.
Ok. That's ok. That's not a problem. Ok, sweetie.
You didn't do that. You're ok. You're ok. Let's lie down. You want to go down? Alright.
Oh, wow! What did you do?
Oh, God! No! No! No! No! No!
Alright. Back. There you are. There you go. Good. Good. Ooh. Show me some attitude.
It's just, we need to get her out of here because no one is going to want to go in there with a woman writhing around on the floor. Wait, wait, wait. But most importantly we need to get her some medical attention. ASAP. Stat.
I don't need you to give me a history lesson. Ok?
I don't care. Bury it. I hope you're happy.
I want you to go downstairs and I want you to shut it down.
You all took a life here today. you did. The life of the party. Erin?
Ok. Phyllis did injure herself. But she injured herself having fun and I don't think she would trade that memory for anything.
Oh, you know. Nohting. She's  - we were hanging out at Cafe Disco and she had a flare up of am existing injury. But she's a tough, old bird. So... A
Ok, Dwight. Ok. Good. I do not want anyone to worry.
What? Oh, just having to much fun. Phyllis, we're going to put you in here. Dwight's going to take care of you.
You having fun?
No. No. No. Here is the deal - one signature for every song.
Oh. Alright. There you go.
Angela. Angela. Angela. May I interest you in a triple espresso or perhaps a dance?
Hey, thank you, Creed. you're really getting this place.
No... cleaning... up.
Oh, no. Not me. Not me. Get out of here. Cafe Disco!  Hey! Come on, man. It's not even to "Y".
Oh yay! Geography joke.  Oh! Wow! Okay. Alright, let's all go home. Come on. See you all tamale.
Uh oh. What's so funny?
You can go to hell.  I'm kidding. Um, sure, I will get you the best iced tea in the world.
Hey.  Arrggh. So would you guys like some lemonade? Or one of you? Or both of you? Either or. The combinations are endless.
A little bit. Uh, I meet a lot of people.
All right. Mmhmm.  Hey.
Mmhmm. Yeah, that's right.
We're just friends.  Hey, hey, wait a second. Who let you in here, is what I want to know.
You bet your fat ass we are.
All right, fatty. I will do it. You know what, we should actually rehearse.
Wow... I'm designing a chair. It's part of your pants. You sit down, you're supported.
Cool. For who?
Newspapers for sale!
Um, no, I just thought we'd wing it. That cool?
We're circling it.
Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Dun-der. Blooo!!
Oh!  Dun-der. Dun-der...
Could we get a Delorean?
Two hundred and fifty dollars is more money than I've ever seen in my life. I will say, C, a gun. He shot himself in the head.
I'm Robert Mifflin.
Yeah, I'm definitely getting in. I'm a shoo-in.
Ahhhh!! Ohhh!! Ahhh!! I was there! Ahhh!! I was a tour guide at Dartmouth College!! Noooo!!!
Ohh, I'm thinking... I'm going to say... B, tour of Dartmouth College.
Yes, I am.
And now, presenting...
Uh, it's a sketch now.
I guess not.
David Wallace told me!!Woman from B
I will say B, Buffalo! Final answer!
Well, he's just thinking about his own gifts.
Well... I didn't know they didn't know.
Me too.  We have a lot of good material for next year's sketch.
Believe me, I have seen a lot of tough audiences in my time, and that was one of them.
No, it was a tough audience.
I think it went well. I think it was good.
Should've had hindsight.
Good to see you.  AJ.
Well you guys should hit the road before... I close down another branch.
Okay, we all go together or we go one at a time.
Did everybody know about this but me?
Oh! Hey, I hired them! Matchmaker! This place is like Spaniard Fly.
If somebody doesn't tell me, I'm gonna start screaming.
Who's getting married?
How do you know this?
Eric likes Megan.
Does anybody else know about this?
Stanley was on your group date?
I'm talking about your group date with Megan and Eric.
Well apparently, he and his wife were out dancing at a club for young people.
Stanly is having a midlife crisis.
Nothing? Well I got a little somethin' somethin'. I don't know if I should say... P
So, what is the scuttlebutt? Anybody hear anything?Dwight, Jim & P
Mmm... okay. Uhh... hmm... okay. Never mind. Carry on.
I don't get it!
Oh, was he? Well who, his sister?
Stanley's wife is out of town.
T! Yes! Yes! That is a "T", and there's another one right there. Just sound that out. You're almost there.
No... no. He's holding a pencil. He could be doing a crossword puzzle with that pencil. What's that letter, right there? Same letter here and here. What haven't you guessed?
Oh, okay, I get it. You feel out of the loop, and you feel sorry for yourself, and it's really sad because everybody thinks you're a loser... J
Did you hear Stanley's having an affair?
Pays five million dollars. Nudity required.
No, no, no, no. I just had a quick question for you. I'm casting a movie and I'm looking for a woman who can dance, beautiful woman. Do you know anybody?
You can count on me.
I'm not saying... a damn thing.
Oh my God! Wait a second, do people often say they're going on sales calls and then go someplace else? 'Cause that's not cool.
Oh, I bet.
So It's not true. Okay, well... ahhh, those interns, they told me they saw you at a club, and they all said it was you, it was clearly just... racial profiling gossip.
Uh huh.  Alright?
Well, the fact that she is apparently dating an 81-year-old billionaire. Owns a Quizno's on the turnpike.
Did you hear about Angela? That's pretty weird.
Nothing can be done, we just have to tell everybody and hope for the best I guess.
Anorexia. She's an anorexatic.
Did you hear Pam is pregnant?
Yeah. So... and Andy is gay.
Okay everybody, big day. Last day for our interns, a lot of other stuff... who knows what to believe? Dwight, the honors.
Guys, guys... you can't believe everything you hear. Like Stanley, having an affair? That is crazy! It's just... there's no stalking it. It's a weird day for false facts. Let it go.
That's not important, Jim, I just think we shouldn't listen to any of that crap.
Yeah, yeah... you know what? Let's discredit these rumors.
Look at that!
Yes. Jim... J
The one true rumor, and this is going to ruin this person's life, is that... J
Okay, okay... here's the thing. There was one true rumor out there today. I didn't want everybody to know what it was. So all of you are off the hook, except for this one person.
Because a lot of people think that models, even though they're very attractive, are somewhat vapid. It's set our industry back quite a bit.
Jim? No, no. I spread the rumor that somebody here was a J. Crew model, and I was referring to myself.
But guys, I'm a victim here too, okay? People here have been saying that I'm a J. Crew model.
Hold on a second, Cynthia. J
Yes, I can. I am going to tell her that I need to redecorate my condo, and I need her help. We will haggle about money, and then I will back down, and then I won't talk to her until this whole Cynthia thing has blown over.
No, no, I can do this.
No, I have to take it, or it'll seem suspicious.
Oh, oh... yeah, a long time ago, just to make sure she was out of town. Oh... oh God.
You should've told me.
Did you pee on a stick?
A week? A month? A year?
My main concern, should I have a safe word?
In your experience, what should I be expecting in terms of sensation or emotions?  Is there anything I can do to make it more pleasurable for me or for Dr. Shaundry?  O
It is a colonoscopy.
Yeah, it's routine.  I'm just a little bit scared.  O
I'm going in for a procedure today.
Yes, Oscar come on in.  Close the door if you would.  Thank you, thanks so much for talking to me.  O
Alright, do you mind if it sit this out?  I have so much work to do, I feel like I'm gonna blow my brains out.
It's okay with me but he's gonna want me in there.
Oh right, this thing. I remember now.    What's this about?
Abso... you know what? I'll do you one better, Sunday, Sunday night.
I just don't want you to.
I just don't want you to lie to me.  I don't want you to ever lie to me.  Have I ever lied to you?  P
If you are lying to me right now Pam, your baby is gonna come out a liar.  That's how it works.  They inherit things through the breast milk.
Well, you said good luck to Jim as he walked in.
You and Jim are close, huh?
No, I think they're talking about me.
Hey, hey, you must have walked right past me.  How you doin'?  D
Very much, Jim is my best friend. But it's his performance report... right here.  Now this was written by Toby, who we all know is extremely reliable.  D
Jim is like Big Bird.  He is tall and yellow and very nice.  But would I put him in charge?  No, I don't think so.  Because Big Bird doesn't make the tough decisions.  I... If I was gonna put someone in charge, I would put Burt in charge or I would put one of the real grown-ups in charge, like Maria or Gordon, maybe.  D
Look who you're talking to.
Just wanted to talk to you about  Jim Halpert.  I understand that he did not receive the promotion.  And I wanted to see what I could do to nudge you in the right direction.  D
Hey David, this is Michael Scott.    Michael Scott here.  D
Kind of in the middle of something here.  E
I never recommended you because I didn't want to lose you and I didn't want to lose Pam,  and now I don't wanna lose the baby.  J
What's happening to me?  I am also being promoted to co-manager, we will be co-managers together.  Jim Halpert, welcome.
Of your butt, and your butt, and your butt, all of the Scranton branch butts.
Everybody, David Wallace and I have talked and we have decided to promote Jim to the position of co-manager.  S
No way, no how. Expense reports are a day-to-day item. That is Jim's now. I am exclusively big picture, epic.
Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
You're trying to trick me.
That is not-- okay-- that is day-to-day.
That is not big picture.
Mmm, sure, but could I first talk to you in my office?
I can be very suprising.
You know what eats a large amount of the day are naps. You go to sleep, it's light out, you wake up, it's dark. That's the whole day. Where did that day go? I have no idea.
At first, we were talking about introducing a line of toilet paper. And what part of the human body does one use toilet paper upon? So you draw a line from there to the other planets, and I think by the end, we all learned a little bit about how small we are.
Alright. Jim, to be fair, the conversation wasn't about planets... J
N-- well, to be fair, Jim... James... Jimothy... To be fair, Jimothy, the-- ah, that sounds weird. Are you okay with being called Jim?
No, I don't think they are. I think the meetings are very important. J
That is not the way I heard it.
That is not what Wallace told us. J
No, no, no, you don't need to go anywhere. Anything that Jim has to say to me, he can say in front of these types of people. J
What do you guys think?  J
Listen, Jim, no offense, but when push comes to shove, what I want is more important that what you want.
Oh, hey, everybody, I think that Jim has gone insane, because he thinks that my office is a conference room.
What do you mean by "these people"?
Stanley, you don't need to answer that.
Yeah, just focus-grouping a product expansion idea to these folks. Got one of each.
Talk to you later--  Alright, I am looking forward to this. J
I thought maybe we could talk after this is over. David W
Hey David, this is Michael, senior co-manager. David W
No, no, no. No, we will not call David Wallace.  I will call David Wallace.
Pro-- you get to share your pros and cons list with the other nerds.
As I was saying it.
Sometimes the smartest people don't think at all.
You use your brain too much.
No, we can do it during the day. It doesn't have to be that dramatic, Jim.
Alright! Let me get this clear! Does everybody want a raise?  Alright, everyone wants a raise, so what we're going to do is go into here, and we will not come out until we do. O
That was good! That was good! Okay, all right. Well, we all know it's hard to be a boss, right? You know what? Look around you. These are your best friends. These are the people who will open their hearts to you. They all have heart-ons for you , and that is a gift. So in terms of gifts, we should be giving each other gifts. Angela, yes, lend Oscar a cup of sugar. This--
This had better be terrible. J
Okay. Well, why don't you tell me what those are, Jim? Why don't you enliven me?
Yes! You went over my head to Wallace!
Oh, I do?! Tell me what they are. J
Mm-hmm. Piece of cake. Ryan, obviously the best. J
I need more time. E
Just pretend we're not here.
You're welcome. J
Um, nothing. I just... I used to have to do this part alone, and it was the worst. I have something I would like to give you.   P
I know, I know. J
Usually a ten, but I'm feeling like a zero. J
Oh, what are you usually?
How you doing?
It's just a really important day for me.
This is what I'm talking about. When we leave here and go up to Niagara Falls we are representing Dunder Mifflin, everyone. This is a very important wedding for the branch. The most important wedding until I get married. So, I want you all on your best behavior or so help me, God. So... I will see you up there in Viagra Falls!
No. No. No. Please, please. Dwight, that's my joke.
Yes. I said that yesterday.
Don't. Don't. Don't. You stole my joke. Don't steal my joke.
And, hey, don't embarrass me when we go to Niagara.
You're an idiot.
Is that all you have on her?
Oh. Well, tell me about Jocelyn.
There's... a name.
Oh, my God, Dwight.
Get out of here.
No. No. That's not how it works.
Are you serious? You want me to play that for a woman coming to my room?
Oh, very thoughtful. A little mix to set the mood. Delightful. Pop that in.
That was nice of you.
Alright. We need some tunes, I think.
Those glasses are super dark.
Ok. 'Oooh. You must pass the dungeon wisdom test.'
I don't have a room?
If I have a woman up there and things are getting amorous, she's going to get turned off if she looks in he bathroom and sees you brushing your teeth with butter and clay.
Um... no. And you know what? I would say yes but you can't. And I'll tell you why.
Oh. Thank God.
Yes... just go--
I would do the same for you.
I'm staying in your--  Come on, Dwight.
Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. I need to stay in your room.
I don't have a reservation but I want a room in the Halpert-Beesly block of rooms.Front Desk C
Mmm-hmm.Front Desk C
You are going to be slepping by yourself for the rest of your life, so you just get used to it.
I'm not a physics major, Stanley. I'm just saying be careful. Hey, guys. Hey. Could I stay in your room tonight?
You... are... kidding me.
Not in the same bed. In the other bed.
Hey. Stanley? Can I stay in your room tonight?
Didn't move my lips.
That is seriously going to impeed my ability to hook up with your female relatives.
Who's doing a toast? I would like to go third. Sort of bat clean up and--
Nice to meet you.Mr. H
How ya doin'?Mr. H
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She's very conservative. So, mum's the word.
What am I supposed to do with that, Dwight?
Well, who's that one?
Head table, where I belong.
Alright. My point is I said what I wanted to say and Mema, I hope you heard every word.
...but it's different for the-- ok. Ok.
When you use something to block-- I think everybody knows what I am talking about. It's not necessarily different for the woman--
When you c-- well? Am I wrong? They say it's not different, but it's a different sensation.
Yes. Yes they were living together. Yes and you know what? You can't expect them to be careful every time. Because, frankly, it's just a different sensation.
Ok. Ok. Hey. What I think Jim is trying to say is that... they had an accident and you know what? These two people, they're living together, they're having lots of consentual sex--
Yeah. Go ahead.
And... you... everybody can laugh. It doesn't have to just be the idiots. Everybody can laugh.
That's not smart. And also, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
That's a car that can talk. Can Smart Car talk? Nope.
That's not appropriate. Hello. Hi, everybody. I promised I wasn't gonna make a toast and I'm not going to. Just going to do a little free standing comedy and if at the end everybody wants to raise their glasses to Pam and Jim, then so be it. Hey, what is the deal with the Smart Car? How smart is that? Those things are tiny. Can you even drive them in traffic? 'I'm so smart. E=mc... squared. I drive a Smart Car.' That's not smart in my book. The real smart car is Kitt from Knight Rider.
There's gonna be a free room?
Can you believe it? He screwed up, not me.
I have not found that to be the case.
I know. I can't believe it was you, either. I actually think it takes a lot of pressure off of me.
Yes. Yep. One in the same. May I?
Yes, and if it's a boy they will call it Sylvio.
They're gonna name the baby after you, you know. They're gonna call it Mema.
Oh. Isn't he terrible? May I? Here's the thing. Umm... Mema, I think you just need to chill out about this whole Pam getting pregnant thing. It's not 1890 anymore. It's modern day. And women have sex before marriage and I think we need to celebrate that. And I know in your day she would be considered a whore but, now, women go out and they have sex and they get wild and they take their tops off and they have pictures taken of them and we need to encouage them. That's part of life.
Oh. Ok. Well... hook you up, there.
Looks like you're going to a fish fry, Dwight.
Dwight, Dwight. Shut up about the farm. It's not relatable. Nobody owns a farm.
Oh, my God. Twins. I'm sorry. You understand. Nice to meet you.
Something is wrong with you.
They're men, Dwight.
Now you sound like Kermit.
She'll be sitting home saying, "Jim... take the baby to the zoo cause I want to sit at home and eat bon-bons."   "And... and clip my toenails."
Oh my God.  You're not going to be able to talk back.
Oh my God, Dwight.  This room is a pit.
No... you're crazy.  D
She's Pam's best friend.  You guys could double date.  Swap maybe?
She was from Europe.
She was cute.  You know?  She was hot.  She was very hot.  She made love like a tiger.
Yeah, I'm hungry, but I'm not going to make a pig out of myself.
Oh, here we go.  They asked for cash, but you know... I give them cash every week, so-- how much cash does a person need?  I have taken it upon myself to do something a little more special.  I have painted a portrait of the two of them from memory.    And I have another one of them in the nude.  But that one is for me.
Oh, I wish I was a bridesmaid.  Where am I gonna go?
I'm sorry.  Ugh.  Apricot.  Made of real apes.
Oh... okay.  Were you saving it?  Pam's m
Oh!  Eww... apricot.  Do you have any of the Very Berry or Ocean Splash or--Pam's m
I'm thinking about having my sperm frozen.Tom H
It is a terrible year for love.Pam's m
And... and the love of my life is dating somebody else.  Pam's m
I came here hoping to meet somebody.  You know, as you do at weddings.  End up going to sleep by the vending machine.  It was loud, but it was warm.Pam's m
Yes! Yes!  I have so much joy...  in my heart... right now.  How do I look?  J
Hey Pam, did you see this? It was on You Tube.
Yeah! That's good! Come on up! Meredith, come up here. Let's do a little something. So Meredith and I have just started conversing and I will say, "So Meredith, how was your weekend, what did you do?"
Yes, what else?
Yes. So, it all starts with a handshake.  But you can't just go right to the selling, you need "small talk."  What topics can you use for small talk?
Come in the conference room and I will show you a finished sausage.
Push free play til tomorrow morning.  Hi. Sorry. Crazy day. You're seeing how the sausage gets made. G
Do you know how creative space works? Okay I just cancelled my afternoon.
Oh hi. I'm sorry, just a sec.  Erin, you're supposed to be the gatekeeper, do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
Mmhm, I hear you. The truck.
Oh yup. Yeah, definitely. All that paper burning up.
I think, he just seemed like he was just trying to sell me insurance.
Wait, when did we start talking about the mob? The guy was trying to sell me insurance.
There is no such things as monsters.
No Dwight, not everything is a threat.
Nothing, other than once again, I am just thankful that I am a paper salesman.
I'm not gonna lock my door.
Okay too many different words coming at me from too many different sentences.
Um it is, Grotti.Andy and D
All right. I will meet with him, but I'm not going alone.
Hold on, hold on! Just-
I don't know, I don't know about that.
That's not gonna happen.
Okay, I'm calling the police. A
Yeah. What are my options here? Do I just ignore it, or?
"I feel that you will regret missing this great opportunity to be in business."  D
Forget it! Forget it!
Let's go, come on.  God!
Guys, guys. Cool it. There he is, there he is.
Oh my God!
Mr. Grotti we meet again. These are my associates.
If the salad is on top, I send it back.
Shh. I will have the spaghetti, with a side salad. W
I don't, I don't have to have that.
I will have the gabba-gool.
Okay shut up.
That's not true.
Put it down.
Yep, all right.
Okay, okay okay.
He's a good mechanic.
Hey, do you need any help?
No, no no, no. Come on. I'm sorry, we're having our salad.
Just get in the car.
It was a lot of snap decisions.
I had to make a snap decision Dwight. D
It's just the cost of a cup of coffee an hour.
Jim?!?  Oh my God.
No, Jim please, repeat what you're saying! I can't understand you!
No!  Oh my God!
No! God! I missed, I missed the important part again!
What? Wait, I didn't hear a thing you just said.
Jim? Are you?
Yeah, I know and you usually can get out of stuff like this, so I'm turning to you my friend.
Oh thank God.
All right. Well, it was a thought. Thanks.
But Grotti acts like he's mafia though.
No. He's not. He's just good. Nothing sticks to him. You still don't understand how this works.
Oh man. I should be mad at you guys. But I'm not.
No. What do you mean?
What a tool.  What?
Doubt it. Dwight and A
How about that? The only person that actually needs insurance is you, if you show your face around here again, got it?
And I'm not gonna buy your stupid insurance.
I think you knew exactly what you were doing. And frankly I think you were being a total and utter jerk.
I think you know exactly why, because you were trying to scare me into buying insurance.
Well you thought wrong. Because I am not pleased. I'm actually kind of PO'd.
Oh really? Is that supposed to scare me?
This is Scott.
Go.  Any questions?
Large. If it's a medium I send it back. If it's an extra large I send it back.
Not from the kitchen. Stop and Shop. If it's not Stop and Shop, I send it back. E
Oh, I haven't see you since my accident that I had when I fell- I fell into the pool of acid, eyes first. Blind guy.
And oh, Jim... P
Is someone there? I can't see you because I'm blind.
She's right on my way home from work.
Okay, good, a pact. A pact. Although I may have to break it tonight when Helene and I tell Pam over dinner. You alright?
And the seats go all the way down. All the way down.
She drives a green camry.
Oh, big time.
Pam's mom, Helene. Remember from your wedding?
Sure. Thanks for asking.
More than a friend, a co-worker.
Part of the problem is, she is the mother of a close friend of mine.
You want me to be happy?
Pam, it is very complicated. There are a lot of moving parts here. J
I was probably going to break up with her anyway.
No, I don't.
I don't deserve this, guys.
That is amazing. I feel like a real Puerto Rican.
I hope that you are willing to die in this office, because I am... P
Do not talk to me that way!  I am your boss and I may someday be your father, so get out.
Shut up Oscar.  Hey, alright, you know what, clearly I'm outnumbered here, but can I just say one thing, please?  What is so wrong about me?  I'm caring, I'm generous, I'm sensual.  Is it really so horrible that I could possibly go out and find happiness.  P
Alright, in my defense... P
For trying to find happiness in the arms of a lover?  P
Anybody else?  Who else has an idea?  A
Okay, I'm out of here,  see you later guys... V
Alright, that's... M
Who wants to help the world one step at a time?   Alright, good.  D
You're a good, good guy.
Can I sit down for a second?
Um, I just wanted to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier that was... uncalled for, I'm sorry.  T
You know what?  I'm gonna start dating her even harder.
Because I assumed that you want me to be happy because I want you to be happy.
Well, that is not gonna happen!
You were right Jim, shoulda listened to you, should never have told her.  P
Join your gangsta pumpkin on his palette truck of doom. Don't worry about a thing. Rest assured you will see me later. Bwah ha ha...   ... ha ha ha.
Kids, just remember, suicide is never the answer. Alright?
Who wants candy?
You should give them a call. Check that out.
I can't believe it's- I can't believe it's yogurt. Uh... it'll be f
Do you like TCBY?
The same stuff you get downtown.
They have a TCBY booth.
Sounds like fun. You guys would love it.
Let me get your stroller.
I don't want you to feel like I'm baby-sitting you, or something. Alright.
Why don't they just want you to go by yourself? Why do they want me to come, too? I don't understand.
That's sorta secondary.
They are into appearance. We are selling success.
They are into style.
...and that is the watch that you are going to wear? No. It is not. You should wear this watch. I will loan it to you. It is a Tankard. I highly recommend you wear that.
Yeah, well... this is not the phone. This is real life, baby, and you gotta own it. Is that what you are wearing?
Mr. Bourchard. They're very formal.
No. What is his name?
It was. It was. And then in an instant it wasn't.
Uh, well, Jim and I got caught in a little flash rain, flash wind, flash lightning.
Ok. Thank you.
No it is- don't! I'm not gonna bump. I'm not gonna bump. And it was not hilarious. It was very, very terrifying.
No. Maybe I was trying to save a child that had fallen in.
It was- Ok. This is what it was. It was these bunch of idiots who had put a fish tank in the ground with no cover and no railing.
Uh... I can't really hear you. I think we have sort of a bad connection.
Ok. Put them on speaker. Hey guys, what's going on?
I know what a flounder is.
I can name Pixar movies, too. Toy Story.
Thank you, Stanley.
Oh. He did? What did he say?
Ok. Fine. Come on up here. Write it yourself. And don't sign your name to it. And nobody look. Everybody look away. Look away.
Ok. That's to broad. It's gotta be something else. How 'bout your stomach? Yeah?  Meredith?
No. I haven't finished writing. Did you sneeze it off? That's it. No more. Ok. Who else? Who else? Everybody's getting their chance.
We are going to make a 'Do Not Mock' list. Ok? Anything that we think might be out of bounds, we put on this list. Anything you put on this list you cannot be teased about. Got it? I'm gonna kick it off. Let's see what I have to put on the list, right?  Ok. I also have fallen into the fountain at the Steamtown Mall. Ok. Who else? Who else? Dwight, come on.
Well, it is hard to tell the difference between you guys saying, 'Stop because I want you to stop' or STOP as in 'Stop. You're making me laugh so hard. What you're doing is so funny. You are on a roll. I am busting a gut. Stop!'
You never said anything.
No. We are not done here. This-
What? No. I could get a fish for a 5 cent worm. C
Do not mock, Oscar. Do not mock. How much do they want?
It could've died of natural causes. So... E
It's a fish.
Oh, my God.
No. Don't do that. You're not. You're not stupid.
I want to make fun of you right now.
Yes, they do, Jim. Because of the time I got my ponytail stuck in the power trail.
No, Jim. You don't understand. Things like this don't just die. Kids in high school still call me 'Ponytail'. J
It's ok. We're having fun. It's not actually the first time I've been embarrassed by a pond. In high school, the girls volleyball team always used to hrow me into the frozen lake. Four years in a row. Oh... it was freezing.  Oh, my God. It was so embarrassing. That was- oh. I don't even have Jan's cell phone number and I hate her! She won't give it to me. I was like, 'Oh, I guess I'm a loser. 'A luh-whooooo a za her'.  Too far! God! Thanks a lot, man. Thanks for the advice.
Well, you know what? You're right, Phyllis, but I've been there before. I've seen that pond. This is the thing, I am a world class moron. That's the problem.
Hey. Who wants to watch Michael's pond dive? My roommate's friend is the night janitor over there. He swiped the security tape for me and he's bringing it over.
I don't think you froze.
I am a grown-up, Jim.
It's alright. I can handle it.
No. It's ok. Watch it. He can't fire all of you.
Is this the tape of me falling?
You're welcome. Whoa!
No. He's a- yeah, he's alright. Ok.
Oscar's a douche.
I don't mind if I do.
No.  I had a fish stick sandwich.  Actually I had two fish stick sandwiches.  My girlfriend didn't want hers.  Because I guess I'm the only aphrodisiac she needs.   D
I think everyone has meet Helene.  Shall we?
Please, Kevin.  You're fired.    Sorry, sorry.  Work with a bunch of idiots.  Shall we go?
Yeah. The rest of the story has been censored due to-- inappropriosity.     K
Today is about family.
Just want you to succeed Pammy.  You know what, we shouldn't even be talking about business today.
Well, it was actually me alone, so-- wow look at this place.  Really makes me want to go to Italy some day.  H
What? All I see are boring old tables with no birthday decorations.  Oh, wait a second!  You mean this one?  Wow!
Nothing.  Just life-- and doing things-- before you die. I don't know.
I am.  I'm definitely going to do it.  I've already got the run and the bike thing down.  Just need to learn how to swim.  Come on, you in?
Yes you will.  P
Oh, no, no, no. No.  It's stupid.  You'd hate it.  I hate it.  H
That was a bunt.
Well, that's because you and I have very different tastes and you like lame things.  It's a generational-- sort of gap between us.  H
Oh that I plagiarized I think.
It's not amazing... at all.  It's sort of weird that I went and did that.  And now your wish won't come true, so that blows.  H
I got thirsty. P
Oh, just went to the bathroom.
I want you to enjoy that cake because I have something terrible  I need to tell you.  I want you to enjoy your cake before I tell you this terrible, terrible thing.
Finish your cake, Helene.
It's not my decision.  It's mother nature.  And mother has very strict rules about fer--   -- tility.
Wow.  That just-- you've really grown.  P
No it's not.  P
Well, hobbies-- J
Ye-- No.  Alright.  I'll take off my jacket and tense my stomach and you can just-- P
No!  No-- no I am not.  Unless you want me to.  DO you want me to? Cause I will.  I will bribe you.  No.  Your face is saying don't-- unless I haven't offered you enough... your face isn't changing.  What is it?  Talk to me face.  Tell me what Pam's brain is thinking.  Come on!  What do you want? What do you want?  Do you want a million dollars?  Do you want to hit me?  Want me to get down on one knee and beg you or-- P
Hey, Pam, Pam-- with this raise there are strings attached.    And the string is attached from my heart to your mean attitude.  P
That's-- no, no-- it's not about numbers, Pam.  It's about attitude.
Because of all the good work you've done.
Yes.  Join me please, won't you?   I am going to give you a raise.  P
Well, this is a work related matter.  P
May I have a word with you in my office please?
I-- mmm-- I'm good.
Never.  About what?  A little-- what are you talking-- R
How much time do you think you'll need?
You gotta do something-- J
Can you stop this?
I mean-- do you ever wrestle with each other?
Do you and Pam ever get frisky?
I don't know.
Maybe that-- P
So many things.  I don't know.  It's hard to choose.  P
Okay!  Pam, Pam-- I'm really sorry.  I'm sorry.  P
I know.  Oh-- God!
What are you talking about-- D
Oh thank you.  Thanks.  I owe you one Dwight.    D
That sounds like it was hilarious.
Oh, the Wall.
Erin, do we have the journal?
Woo hoo, shout out!
You'll have to be more specific Dwight, I get like eight emails a day.
Oh God.  Well, that's an interesting theory.
Oh, that sounds awful.
No, no, that doesn't make any sense.
It's $1.99 to finish the article.  I wonder what it was going to say?
OK, OK.  Good.  I'll catch you on the flippity flip.  Bye.   He's busy, he'll call me back when he's free.
Ah, well maybe you should spy on him.  David Wallace's S
Crazy world.  Lotta smells.
No, I'm just poopin'.  You know how I be.
We have a monthly staff m
Monkey pee all over you.
Monkey see, monkey do.
OK, we need some sort of distraction for everybody.  Anything new on YouTube?  Doesn't even need to be good.  Oh God, I can't think, need more Mullins. J
Tube City, you owe me one.
This is my call Jim, big picture stuff, it's about murder.
It is so much fun.  Everybody plays a character, we go around the room, we try to figure out who did it... J
There will be food. You leave, you do not get food.
OK, use your imaginations.
Well how do you think I feel?  I mean I have to play Caleb Crawdad, handsome playboy.  Every night, a different woman.  Being oogled.  Having to hug and kiss and spoon, I make them feel beautiful.
It's not scary.
Delta Burke, I do declare.  Now, shall we get to the mystery?
That is the way Southern people talk.
Who's Michael?  I'm Caleb Crawdad, I do declare.
No, no, no. Don't turn this into a political thing.
Oooooo, doggie, we got a party now!
Very good, very good.  Now, no one was there in the wine cellar.
Sir, there has been a murder, and you are a suspect.
No no no no no no no.  I'm going to skip forward to a relevant clue.  Here we go.
Whoa. What's this strange Yankee accent coming out of your mouth, son?  This here's Savannah.
Nellie Nutmeg, come back in here.  I can't do this myself.  Voodoo Mama Juju... what am I gonna do?
No it ain't.
I do believe you have me mistaken, my name is Caleb Crawdad. Y'all skedaddled way too soon.  We need to reopen this case.
You are out of order.
This is not a game, this is my life.  You are out of order, sir.
I already declared you, it was too dark to tell.
To Mama Juju Boo Boo.
Can't wait, we have to get you to our witch doctor right now.  Come on.  Come on.
No Michael here, my name is-
Because this is the recreation of a crime scene.
No, I only answer to Detective Wallace 'cause I got a warm body in the other room.
Aw, shucks, tell him I'm not here.
Get in there!
A murder, you say?  I do declare.
One, two, three..
We'll put down our weaponry on the count of three, you ready?
On the count of three we're all going to put down our guns.
Nope. Then my face is down. They can't see my face. M
I want it to be better than 'Great', Pam. How 'bout I remain seated... and I just do a little bit of a nod. Sort of a humble thing.
Ok. Obviously I'm not going to do the twirl. I only did it because I nailed the wave.
They sent a limo.
It's not a limo. It's a town car. Town cars are actually better, though. Better torque. Better handling.
Well, could you condense it please?
Ok, Oscar, I don't need the whole enchilada just the bullet points.
The limo seats eight. Ok. Then Jim and Pam and Ryan plus a guest.Jim & P
Hey, you know who you should be jealous of? Yourself. Because you're invited and you're invited and you're invited and you and you and you and you and you and you-Limo D
Hate to break it to you Oscar but some of us like boobs.
Who's playing with the button?
Definitely. Look they got pillows. That. That's bigger than my bed.
Oh, my god. This is it.
No, no. That's too hard. Say your name is Zamboni and then I will say, 'Well, we're sort of on thin ice.'  I won't say that. I'll something like that.
I will have to answer.
See you later.
Well, I guess this is as far as I can take you guys. So -
Well, thank you and, and please call - continue to call me Mr. Scott.
Ah.  Your eminence.
It's nice to meet you, too. It's an honor and a privilege. D
Oh. It was awesome. Very, very sublime.
Rock and roll.
What about Madonna? Or Obama twins? Anybody famous?
They are really angry.
This is not as much fun as I thought it would be.
Hey, hey, hey. I'm sorry. These are not criminals. They are nice. They invited me to come here today. They invited me to their hospitality suite where I  had free food and it was delicious. Get this. Know how nice they are? The sent a stretch limo all the way to pick me up in Scranton. That's -Female S
Ok. Alright. We are gonna - we're gonna go out there during this break and we are gonna come back with a plan. We're gonna come back with a plan for you. It's a 45 day plan. 45 days to get us back on track.  You. You.
I - ok. I know that you're mad at me and you're mad at all them -Fourth S
Well, I'm texting him, so.
Ok. Alright. Well, I know a guy. This Mexican guy. He is a math whiz. He knows economics as well as he knows bull fighting and I am going to call in a little favor.
They were so happy down there.
Got them on their feet. D
I am the guy who roused that crowd. D
Just whatever comes to mind. Shout it out.O'
Here's what we're gonna do. The 45 day thing that I outlined, we go with that. Day 45, company saved. Day 44, go. What do we got? We have 15 minutes.O'
I did wave. I did a lot more than wave.
Uh, I'm not a moron. Time after time my branch leads in sales. I have personally won over 17 Dundie awards. So, I am not a moron and I am just trying to help, you know? So... you're the moron.
That was embarrassing.
Wow, man. That - O
O-kay. Oh... hey, hey.  What are you doing?
That wasn't what you were saying to me. He was much more articulate and that was better. Much better. O
It's all good. It's all good stuff. Lay it on them.
You're welcome, baby.
Well, thank you... thank you a lot.  And for what it's worth I think your baby voice is tops.
Okay, who said that?
You can't be a baby in the office.  It makes me look like I hire babies.
You are also on record as saying "wittle-ittle," "footy-wutties," "nummies," "jammies," "make boom-boom," "widiculous," and "wode iwand."
I have it on good authority that you said the following.   Can you read that back to me?
Okay, right there is the problem.  There have been reports around the office that you have been talking baby talk.
Yeah, Have a seat.
It would look good, on my mantle.
Well, technically, I'm a co-manager, and I barely have any responsibilities, but I work hard, I love this company, and for those reasons, I think I would make a good employee of the month.
Yeah, you know what, that actually might make me feel better.  I'm not in this for the trophies, but...
Is that what we're going for now?  "okay?"  We used to go for "pretty good."
Lurk much?   I miss Pam.
Worse than that.
What if I told you I had done the worst thing ever, would you still want to be my friend?
Must be hackers.
Oh okay.  I don't know how those got on there...
I want to keep those so I can see what I sent.
There you are.  I don't think we have finished with my Inbox.
Yeah, okay.  Call the school, cancel.  I can't go through with this.
To change lives.
Agh, God, you know what, could this day get any worse?
Would you come with me?  You know, like old times, instead of...
I'm not a bad person, I bring good news.  Like when I promised those kids I'd pay for college.  Okay, all right.
No, not at all.  Nope, come on.
Well, you didn't even hear it.
Eigth grade graduation, she gave a rendition of When The Saints Go Marching In that would blow your freaking mind.
Good to see you.  Where's your saxaphone?
Hey, Mikela Lasker, how are you?
Oh, God.  Oh, God.
Well Zion, I am not going to be paying for your college tuition.  Which brings me to my main point and that is that I will not be able to pay for anybody's tuition.  I'm so, so sorry.
All right.  Wow.  Um, I am never going to forget today.  Not a chance.  I don't think I could ever give back to you what you have given me today.  Who here has done something stupid in their lives?  Like skipped out on study hall or mix up the difference between "A" gym and "B" gym, that sort of thing?  Show of hands, anybody, yes, a bunch of you, okay.  Well, me too, I've done something stupid which I would like to share.  Ummm.  Should we go?
Hey, hold-hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.  They're lithium.
Okay, hold on.  Hold on.  Now I can't pay for your college.  But you don't have to go to class to be in class.  Online courses are a viable option to a traditional college experience.  And the best way to access those courses is with your own personal laptop.  Which is rendered useless without batteries, and I have one for each of you.
I lied to myself too.  I'm not a millionaire.  I thought I would be by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even close.  And then I thought maybe by the time I was 40, but by 40, I had less money than when I was 30.  Maybe by my 50s, I don't know.  I wanted to pay for your education.  I really did.  It was my dream.  Some people have evil drems, some people have selfish dreams or wet dreams.  My dream was in the right place.
That's a lot of zeroes.
For-okay, okay here's what I'm gonna do.  I'm going to write 4 checks for $1,000 each.  I'm going to date them one year apart.  Now, you are to use one check a year.  And please call me before you cash the check?  Cause I've got monies to move around.
Really? Wow.  That's over $200 a year.
Yeah, well, I owe you that at least, right?
I can give you an extra laptop battery.  Not everyone took one.  How about this?  If you can find a way to pay for your college tuition, let me buy your books, okay?
What can I do?
Yeah. Yeah. I know, I know, I know, I'm sorry.
Erin, can you give us a second?
Yeah.  I just sort've had a feeling about him.  I have a feeling about you too.Michael and E
You know, when I hired Kevin, he was actually applying for a job in the warehouse.
What do you want from this job, provided the company doesn't go out of business?
I think you're doing a great job.
You're what, like, 12?
Please stop.  15 lives.  I destroyed 15 young lives today.
What the hell is going on?
Fine! Then do it anonymously. Ransom note style. You can- I -you know what, I have a bunch of letters cut out of magazines in my desk. You can use those.
It's insane! A woman Santa, where does it stop? No! Jim, this may be the last Christmas that we have here, doesn't it make you a tiny bit anxious, me NOT playing Santa? Come on!
No? No! Jim! Come on!
Take it back. That is absurd.
Okay you know what you get? You get a thousand helium balloons attached to you so Santa doesn't have to go through this again.
Okay get off, get off!  Oh! Oh, God!
Damn it Kevin, come on.
All right, just say "some toys" please.
What did you think was going to happen?
What would you like for Christmas little boy?
Right now! Come on over here, big boy! There we go.  Oh my God.
Oh! I am so sorry that Phyllis hates you. And hates your body. But, Santa remembers a reindeer that was just a tiny bit different as well.
No it's not, not like penis-wise.  Hello little boy, what's your name?
I'll get some punch. That looks delicious.
No no no wait! No! There are other choices, there is information that we -- Are you kidding me? Kevin? After you almost killed me?
Hey! Okay! Everybody! The office is being pulled apart! I realize that. There are traditions at stake. And there are--
Oh, do we? Do "We?" Is that what "we" want? Why don't "we" take a vote on it?
Do you understand, you forced my hand?
Whoop! Okay, what?
Just sit down!
Ahhh... Ho ho ho!  Come on I need this. Come over here! R
Come on, come on.
Well you have to pick one or the other. Your choice. Pick your poison. Get back to me. In the meantime, I am going to spread my goodness all over this company!
Oh but I can push drugs in here? Is that what you're saying?
Oh the Anti-Christ! T
What? Turn it back on.
Andy had Erin.
That's fantastic. You can make another dress that goes past your feet.
I can't see from here people. Somebody shout it out, don't make me get up.
Oh, that's appropriate. Lot of fire where you're going. Better get used to it. You're going to H-E-L-L double hockey sticks. You're going to Hell Stanley.
Yeah, except for cheating on your wife. Adultery's a sin, look it up in the Bible people. What'd you get?
Oh yes. It's space garbage. Dwight's gonna be able to build himself a friend!  Deck the halls with crappy gifts...
Oh my God.
All of us?
Hey! Get off! Get off the phone!
What the hell? How rude! Does she do that all the time?
Really? What's going on?
I'm Jesus, David, and you know why? Because Phyllis, a woman, has uslurped my role as Santa.
I'll give you a hint. His last name is Christ. He has the power of flight. He can heal leopards.
David, guess who I'm sitting here dressed as.
"It's fun to stay at the -"
I don't want to say. But, "it's fun to stay at the -"
You know what's even more offensive, is baling on this party because some...  jerk ruined the first part of it. Dwight come here. Here's my debit card, I want you to go pick up a bunch of pizzas and meet me in the conference room.
That was a different guy. That was Jesus. Jesus sort of ruined the party. Hurt petulant Jesus.
Yes, I will. Because I always know how to get through to him.
I'll call him. I'll call David.
It's hard for me to imagine a scenario, where Meredith Palmer keeps her job and David Wallace does not - no offense Meredith.
David's gone. Alan's gone. We're all gone.
Dwight! Jesus! A
He said, we have been sold.
Earlier today. D
David told me on the phone. David told me.
We're going out of business!
I didn't say anything!
It's not... Nevermind. Nothing.
Yeah!  It's a Christmas miracle! D
We're not fired?
Well I think we're past that now.
David, they do not believe me. When you told me everyone was canned.
David, you are on speakerphone with the entire branch, and the warehouse.
Stephanie could you hop off please?
It's not sweetie, it's Michael Scott.
Huh. Well, maybe those will help.
Oh God. Get a room Santas!
You called Bob? P
I'd like to make a wish.
That is fantastic. It's good, but it's not good enough. Keep working. And here's Pam. She's our international sales consultant.
Pacific Ocean. Pretty cool, huh?
What is the world's largest ocean?
I see you've met Computron, our virtual helper. I'm Michael Scott. Welcome. Welcome. Computron is just one of the many modern devices that I have incorporated into the office. Watch this. Computron?
Oh, my God.
No, Computron, actually I think Cooper's is the best. You're gonna love it.
They make the best Maine lobster in the world. You'll love it.
- since you made the trip out. And I got us reservations at Cooper's Seafood. You like lobster? You've had lobster before, right?
Ok. Well, I thought I'd show you around a little bit - E
Oh, time and resources.
Waste? What does that even mean? Like garbage?
HR stuff?  What is that? What kind of stuff is that?
Stuff. I love stuff.
That's, that is true.
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut - C
Just - sh -
Computron, I'm gonna pull your plug. Ok? Buddy?

It's from "Sob-ray", our new owner, and it is to Sabre, us. I wonder what's inside. Scissor me.
And distributed things which should not have been distributed.
Hey, hey. I have opened a box, which should not have been opened...
Why do I have to explain everything?
Alright, he's on his way up. Okay. Are we ready?
Thank you. Oh! Got it. Ok.
Alright, relax. We can do it. We just did it. So we can do this again. Erin, scissor me please.
Yes, say-ber. Good. Take it away guys.
Sabre. Say-ber. Sabre.
In training. J
Hello, Gabe. I am Michael Scott, co-manager. This is my protege, Jim Halpert. J
You know what, Dwight? Let's give him a minute to settle in, shall we? Ok?
You know what can't fit in a bottle, are the 20 little trips I take to the cooler, and the 20 little scans I do of everybody to make sure everything's running smoothly. And the 20 little conversations that I have with Stanley.
I don't know what they're made of.
So maybe we should call. We should call someone. I could help. I'm good with bosses. Call one of the higher-ups?
All of them.
Well, you should have a little. But it's great that you don't, because I am trying to embrace all of these changes, but I'm - I'll be honest, I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of 'em.
I have already told him, but I will tell him again if you think that will help.
Well, I am little concerned with all of these changes, to be quite frank. I think we have done things a certain way here at Dunder Mifflin for quite some time, and -
Nice to meet you. We are very excited about the merger with Sabre. I think you have a great accent.
Hello. No. My name's Michael Scott. Hello.
Hey. Wow. D
Oh, yeah, that sounds good.
You look great too. D
I don't know. D
Hi. Sorry, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I'd come by, see...Mrs. W
Oh, man. How much time do you have?
Can I just stay here and never go back?
No, I think it is-
So the kid's making the noise to pick it up.
Thanks for having me.
No. This is my toast.  I think this whole thing with Sabre is going to work out. I have a very good feeling about it. P
But I feel pretty good right now. I really do. A lot better than I did earlier. Let me tell you. A
Okay, put it on my card.
Alright, I would like to cancel my reservation, please.Hotel E
That's it!Hotel E
Well, I have been booked for three years, so you should have that. I've always heard that British Columbia is a very nice place, but I am not getting that from this conversation.
Um, come on.
No.  We're trying to look it up right now.
Okey doke.Hotel E
Hello Vancouver, this is Michael Scott calling from the United States of America!  I have a reservation in your fair city from February 12th to the 19th, first week of the Olympics.Hotel E
Pleasure to meet you, Miss Bennett.
Because, well, Jim. Where I'm from, two types of f
I humbly accept the management position.
Forget the question...
And sometimes I can hardly handle that!
I will try to manage my excitement!
No, we know. Texas!
Sure. You here to tell me that you think I would be a better manager and that you are sorry for being such a jerk?
...Where did you get that information.
Why, is there an untapped gay market?
Oh, that is my favorite ocean! I love it! I am so happy right now. No! I can't keep it a secret any longer. Jim is stepping down to salesman, I am going to be the sole manager once again.
What are you reading?
Great! That's great. Congratulations. Have fun signing my commission checks, boss.
I'm turning myself in right now!
No, I think I would be bad. I would sleep in my office, and I would sexually harass people.
Yeah. You can take the man out of the salesman, but you can't take the sales out of salesman.
Really? Aw, that is so sweet of you! But, I cannot accept, because I have been thinking about it, and I think I wanna go back to sales.
Oh, yeah. Fine, fine. Leave it here. I have to make some sales anyway. Who should I call with my magic sales fingers?  Michael Scott, head of sales.
No excuses Erin, come on! Make it happen.
How is that possible?
Why not? It's part of the sales experience.
Oh my God.
And you guys are okay with this?
Are you kidding me?
No, this is geological.
You know what, we don't have to deal with this. I am going to Google sulfur maps.
No, I'm serious, we don't have to put up... Is it the dogs?
We make a poster that says "Happy Opposite Day!" and she sees it on the way out... Nah, that's stupid. Ugh! I wish we had one of those amnesia flashlights from Men in Black.
I really need my job back. We made a terrible mistake here.
Yeah. Except there's no grass out there. It's just a farty dirt patch.
You know, it's funny. I used to stand in here and wish I was out there. Now I'm out there, and I wish I was in here.
And weirdly I'm a good dog person, right guys?  See? They love me.
What? What I'm saying...
Erin, what about my keyboard?  Aw, so good to be home. How about a little Bosa Nova?
Shut up, Nick.  What a weird thing to say.  Weird I.T. nerd.  Don't get revenge on me, nerd.
Oh, yuck!  TMI!  How was it?  I don't want to know.  Tell me later.  Let's go!  Let's go!  Hospital!
Well, the baby was conceived here, so might as well live here a little bit, too.
Happy to do it.  Also, I did a heck of a job baby-proofing this office.
Actually, I put diesel in this time, trying to save some money.
Oh, oh, oh!  Contraption!  She's contrapting!  Okay, you know what?  I think I should drive you guys to the hospital, and here is why.  I am a licensed, classy driver in the state of Pennsylvania.  I gassed up the car...
Distractions are good!  That means conference room, five minutes!  No, no, five seconds!  Right now, right now!  Conference room!  Topic, potpourri!  Let's go!
No, no, no, no, no.  You know what?  You can't tell us what to do because you are not co-manager anymore.
That sounds good!  Do you need some music, or...?  Okay.
Nope, nope, I don't think anybody wants to see that.
Does anybody have anything?  Anything interesting, any hobbies, uh, special skills?
I will allow that.
I think he is.
Ooh, someone's freakin'.
Okay, the opposite of that?
Okay, yeah, why don't you go get it?
Okay, nobody touch Pam's nipples.  Think of Pam's nipples as Toby's grundle.
Jim, as a matter of fact, I have printed out ten ways to induce labor.  And I'm thinking we just do the opposite of those things and we can slow down your labor.  Erin, read the first one.
Yeah, happy times.  Come on.  Let's have happy times.
What is October feast?
Oh.  What?  You want to eat cat food with Kevin and not go to the hospital?
We can do...
4:35.  Alright, almost made it.  Almost made it.  Too bad you didn't have sex like seven and a half hours later.  But you had to have the afternoon delight.  I understand.  Sometimes you have to go for it.  Let's go to the hospital, shall we?
Pam, Pam!  Okay, alright, okay, it's time.  Time to go to the hospital.  Somebody get Jim, please!  Is it midnight yet?
Yes!  We're going to the hospital and we're going to have a baby.
Yes, you are.  And you know what you're going to have?
You're not going to.  You know where you're going?
We're okay, Jim!  Okay, Pamela.  You know what time it is?
I know, I know, I know.  It went by too soon.
Two minutes apart.
Let's do that.
We're going to have a baby.
I'm scared, too.
You can do this.  You can do this.
Are you kidding?
Let's go, Pam.  Yeah, I think we should head out.
That's right, let's do this.
Okay, okay, Jim.  I think this feast is over and it's time to go to the hospital.
Thank you!  Wish me luck!
No, no, no.  Dwight, let Jim do that, please.
You are telling me now that there is nothing in it.  Okay, great!  Oh, hey, hey, um, should I bring a dictionary to the hospital?
Go bag! Where's my go bag?  Where's my go bag?
No, Jim, you are in no condition to drive.  I will drive you.  Check!  Got it.
No, no, no, no!  Out, out!  Idiot.
Come on, Stanley!  Okay.  We're going now!
Okay, go, go, go, go!
By the bushes?
I'm texting about you, okay!?
Okay, just breathe...  She?  You found out?  Come on, guys.  I wanted to be surprised.
Hello, Dwight.  Pam left her iPod at her house.  I want you to swing by, pick it up, and bring it to the hospital.  We need it yesterday.
Guys, guys!  Stop fighting, come on.  Come on.  Do you want your kid to come out a lawyer?  Right?  Okay, you know what?  I am all over this.  Here we go.    Ready?
Dunder-Mifflin.  It's okay.    I just did.
Okay, alright.  Hospital e
Do you have everything, guys?
Okay, not yet, not yet.  I'm going to go wash my eyes.
Where is my little nibblet?  Halpert, room D1.  Alright, family only beyond this point, thank you.  Here we go.
Oh, my God.  Go, go, go!  Are you insane?  Alright.
Phyllis, what could you possibly have to do?
I think it's going to be any minute now.
You're starting, you're kinda losing them.
Okay.  You can't smoke anywhere these days.
Thank you!  Thank you!
Mm-hmm.  Oh.  Ooh, wow.  Michael.  Michael.
Ooh, I want to hold the baby!
Love you, as a friend.
Hello.  Oh, good for you.  I worry about you.
Ha ha, you got that right!  Meredith?  Come on, you're obviously single.
Okay, show of hands.  Who wants to live in a world where Stanley has two lovers and you don't have any?    Who else?  Come on!  People, I know models!
I am offering up my services to you all.  You saw what I did with Pam and Jim.  I can help you, too.
Who else here is single?
I'm not so sure.  Kevin has an enormous heart.  Literally, he has an elephant heart.  He had a transplant when he was seventeen.  Had some problems, blah blah blah.
Okay.  This is going to kill Kevin.
Sure.  Kevin, please leave.
Okay, hold on.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  You got to let the cookies cool before you pop 'em in your mouth.  Why don't you guys get to know each other?  Maybe have lunch together?
I would like you to meet your new boyfriend.
What would you say, if I told you that I was about to change your life?
Just don't let him sit on you...  I'm kidding.  You'll have fun.  It'll be good.  It'll be good.  There he is.  Go to him.
Kev...  Nice.  Going.
This isn't about me, and that is debatable.  And I have a personality, where as you...  Yes, Andy?
Lynn was as hot as Erin.
Okay, even if someone told you that, you should know that that could never be possible, Kevin.  And I'm surprised that you didn't question me in the first place.
Oh, my God, this is agonizing.  Look, Kevin, do you really think that you could have dated Erin?
Mm, that sounds great, actually.
No, no no- that is a good gift actually. Buildings here in Scranton are literally powered by coal.
It is. This is a little something for you to remember your time here in Scranton by.
You know what, in the spirit of full disclosure, I have actually reserved a bunch of different seats on a bunch of different flights, but there are a couple of flights that only have two tickets left, so I think we should pull the trigger and -
How about July 4th weekend?
Well, I am heading down there. J
Oh no! Say it's not so, Jo, we're gonna miss you, we're gonna miss you so much!
Look at that picture that you drew. Nice job! We're very proud of you. You know what, we're gonna tape that up on the refrigerator in the kitchen.
Daryl. Mellow, soulful, smart for warehouse...
Oscar, homosexual accountant.
I'll be over there.
All right. Well if you need me, I'll be on the other side of that wall. Knock once for yes, twice for no.
No is not an option.
How do I put this delicately? Does her family owe your family something, in terms of a past injustice?
Hm mm. Seriously, how did you do it?
A real Hoop Dreams story you got there. Oh man, you seem to have caught Jo's eye. How'd you make that happen?
No, no, no. That's super-clear-ish.  Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
Mm. mm. Oh well.
Mm? Well, the clock says chatting time, so. J
Yeah. Maybe next year.Todd P
Ah damn. That sounds great. Unfortunately I am stuck here, because my boss is making us work late.Todd P
How's the lady situation?Todd P
How you doing stud? You already there?Todd P
Why does she do that? Why doesn't she just tell you what your schedule is?
How late do we have to work tonight?
Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day.  And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.
I'm thrilled with the work they've done today, both quality and the quantity. Great performance, Very, very solid all the way around. J
There is, as a matter of fact. It's getting sorta late. It's 8:30. And it's St. Patrick's Day, which is a world ethnic holiday. So I have decided I'm going to dismiss my employees.
Oh -hoh! All right.
Drinks are on me!
Okay. Okay, all right. Best night ever.  What the hell is going on back there?
I know! It also explains why the name on his mailbox was M Shulman.
I know, I know.
Yeah. Well, it wasn't him.
No. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.
Captain Jack Sparrow. Captain Jack Sparrow, Jim. J
Hey, Jim, Jim - where, where do I find the Black Pearl? J
In my condo complex.
I am flattered. That's Johnny Depp.
Look at him. Look at him - t-shirt, jeans...
I would like your undivided attention, please.
No sales topic per se.
Ah, yes, the leads. The leads that Sabre has spent $50,000 to get from a market research company... are not here yet. But will be..  No, no, meeting's not over.
Is that all you have to say to me?
I'm just saying, that - J
Okay. Don't gloat. Here's the thing. This kind of money can corrupt people. J
Well, it's a pretty big check.
You writing your memoirs over there?
Stop sexting Pam. I'm trying to congratulate you.
You saw who did this and you didn't stop them?
Oh, you got to be kidding me.  Look at that. That's - D
Ah, just the stupid leads.
Thank you very much.
Exactly that. G
Exactly that. G
Then we are just rewarding their bad behaviour. Okay. Just - imagine that instead of going to jail for murdering someone, you got an ice-cream cone. If that were the case, then in the summertime, everyone would go around killing people for the pleasure of an ice-cream cone.
I'm giving them the leads, Phyllis.
And to King Angela! . P
Or is it?
Wait. What day is today?
Okay, no, you encouraged it. You were complicit  Complicit. You were all successories!
Well, that's not the way it's going t sound. Here's what we're going to do. We'll go to the dump, we'll look around, then we'll all go out and get pizza, maybe catch a movie, late-night drink, some more pizza, call it a night. What do you - T
Why? Because I am not going to call Sabre and say, 'Hi, you know those very valuable expensive leads that you gave us earlier today? Well, because of a screw-up by a staff member, they're now in the city dump."
Yeah. Sometimes the acorn just stays the acorn. If you don't believe me, look in my gutters.
Don't even think about that
No no. You just made an enemy with the wrong guy, Dwight.  Time in!
If I wanted to hit you, I would have hit you. D
That's my wife you're talking about, man.
You know what, I should have been doing? I should have been out at bars, finding my soul-mate, finding my wife, making babies - D
You think you would have done better without me? Really?
No, I'm talking about your personality, Dwight.
We're never going to find those leads, are we?
In the dump.
Know what would be a great picture here? Just this whole dump, and in the middle, one flower. That's it. And the caption would r
Yeah, she does - she loves purple.  Does it stink?
Yeah, I'm betting one more.
Oh, wow, that is adorable!
What do we got? Creed, disqualified.
Gets to go home.  Disqualified!
My respect.  Okay, I'll make it a little more interesting. Anyone who does more than 25 push-ups -
Oh, yeah, sitting on your big fat butt. Alright, that is the number to beat.
Oh, what did you do today?
Oh, new record!
How many is that?
It's a deal.
I am in.
No, I got that.
Ok, yes. Sure. A
Ladies and gentleman, it is quitting time. A
That would be sublime.
Sucks to be you.
It's not a birthday, it's not a good-bye party...
What is a nice girl like you hanging out with these bums for?
Hello, how are you?
No. No, not really. Not really, but they better not win.
Oh, no, no. Pam and Jim work for me. And if they win, they are fired.
Yes. I feel like an idiot. Awesome.
See, I didn't think you could teach that. I thought that was something you were born with. What am I thinking right now?
Uh, yeah, sure.
She's nice. J
Guys, come on, I'm on a date. Let me do my thang.
Wow. Oh, wow, that was close.
I'm tying a knot in the stem with my tongue.
Well, I am starting it again!
You let somebody talk to you like that, where does it stop?
She can't talk to us that way.
Okay, all right. Okay, whoa. I'm just kidding around. I'm sorry. P
Yes. Homelessness. What?Bar M
Really? You told on me. That's lame.
Hey, she can tell I'm on a date, right? Right? I'm just having fun.Bar M
Yeah, why don't you send the bill to 23 I Don't Care Lane, Scranton, Pennsylvania?
No, you shut up.Bar M
I own a Chrysler.Bar M
Read it? I own it. But no, I have not read it.Bar M
I've written all of it... in my head.Bar M
Yes it is. I am writing a book about it.Bar M
I am here with my employees. I am here on a date. Hello.Bar M
Oh, hey guys.
He is I.Bar M
No, it's Michael Scott.Bar M
No, no.Bar M
I did. I actually put it in your bowl.Bar M
I think I did. But I can't take all of the credit. Some of the credit is due, in fact, to my good friend, Date Mike. Nice to meet me.
Halperts, wait up. Oh, what a great night. Got to hang out with my peeps. Sort of did okay with a new young lady. J
Okay. All right. All right. Okay. I'll take her to lunch.
She's kind of a rube.
A one-on-one lunch with Erin?
I'm going to give Erin $15.
Okay, let's go to Hayworth's.
Okay, well, we'll figure something.
Well, Hayworth's is more business casual, and they always screw up your order. So I'm...
I wanted to know what your plans for lunch were because I was hoping to ask you to... lunch.
I don't know. E
I'll have what she's having!
Okay, okay. You know what? You know what? You know what? Everybody's looking at you right now. E
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Yeah, I asked for pickles with my burger. And there are only, like five or six. Could I get some more pickles?Hayworth's w
They were engaged, so...  Okay, you know what, sir?Hayworth's w
I don't know. Probably didn't want you to have a mental image of him having sex with somebody else. E
Mm-hmm. You didn't know that? Oh.Hayworth's w
I don't think he is the best dresser.  Reminds me of Easter.
Other than the fact that he dated Angela, I don't think he is a snappy dresser.
Well, let's see. Um... Andy. Plays the banjo.
So how are things going with Andy?
No. No. No. A
You know what, I think we can all agree that Angela's not so great, so..
You know what, I resent the implication that I would keep that secret. Everyone here knows that I can't and won't keep a secret.
Andy, she's not the easiest person in the world to have a conversation with. All right? And besides, who doesn't tell their girlfriend that they were engaged to someone who works four feet away from them? That's like.. that's like Mr. and Mrs. Smith crap.
Ahh! You said it! You know who you would love? Oh, this guy in my neighborhood, Tom Dizemore. This is h
You said butt.
Oh. Yep. I'm sorry about that. I feel... I'm sorry I caused that thing. E
No, no, I was just watching Cookie Monster. It finally downloaded. Mind if I sit down?
No, no, no, no. Solamente en espanol, por favor.
Yo soy Cancun.
Damn it.  Ah, Angelo.
Oh. Eso es lo que dice, el!
Hi. How are you?
Did somebody order a hooker over here?
Okay, I have more of them.
Because I keep getting these magazines sent to me via the address of the woman who used to live in my condo before me.
Sorry to interrupt. Sorry to interrupt. Do you, Donna, by any chance shop at Victoria's Secret?
Jim! Could you come in here for a sec? What was that printer we were looking at?
Oh, thanks.  You're not bad, either. D
And that's it. That's me. That's who I am. D
I think we could.
Maybe wee find some wiggle room?
So maybe we could find a little wiggle room, right? J
If she is, it's working. K
I carry mints with me sometimes. You ever tried those?
Operating blahdy blahdy blah. Boilerplate. Pound of fish.  Just kidding. Do you like mints?
Okay. What do you think?
Okay, guys, guys, guys. Just tell me it's not totally insane to try one more time.
No, guys, guys, guys. Guys, just... thank you for talking. Wish me luck.
Here we go.
Oh, what's that out there?
And have a good elevator ride.
Ahem. So, um... okay, if you have... if there's any other questions that you have... D
Okay. So... Oh, Donna?
I don't know. I think so.
I know. You're right. Thank you. Thanks everybody.
Yeah, I know. I know.
Yeah. This could be a signal. People don't just take barrettes off. O
Okay. Maybe she wants me to return this to her at her work. J
God. She left this here?
Was it the cleavage?
Oh. You're still here. I have your baguette.
No, no. No.
No, I'm serious. It... this happened. I went down to the parking lot and I was... I returned her barrette  We ki... We did. Okay. We did. We did.
Nine dates. I said it on the second date. A
All right.   And she won't say, "I love you."
How do I not make any more of it?
You guys think Donna's cheating on me?
You know what, Kelly? This is the real world. Not The Real W
Because when your super-hot girlfriend says, "I wanna go to Mount Pocono," you go to Mount Pocono and you do her. And we screwed. Whoops. TMI. K
Yes, Jim, I do. And I can't stay in a relationship that is full of lies and deceit. J
No, no... P
This is you. How much do you charge?
Oh, yeah. Yes, yes. Yes. All of, all of the greatest loves of my life. J
God, this is so disgusting. P
It's too late to undo it. I need to know. Otherwise this thing is going to spiral out of amok. P
Because I have him investigating her. I'm waiting for a text update.
It's never too early for ice cream, Jim. But we didn't have any ice cream, so this is mayonnaise and black olives. P
No, what happened with Donna?
No, I like the attention. Is she here yet? E
We are? D
Oh, my God, Vero Beach. No. Is that on the water?
...poop my pants.
Well, you are boner-ific.
If you wanna dump me, I totally get it. D
Ye... pfff. Well, no. It's a lie. That's not what happened. I just like you. I can't believe I get to be with you. You work at an adult arcade. You could have any man you want. D
I didn't. Everybody else here did. Everybody convinced me that something was up. They poisoned my mind.
Yeah, I just remembered that I have to go to the bathroom. Pam?
Okay, weirdo. P
Oh, my God. Look at how cheap street level rooms are. Am I the only person who enjoys people watching?
Wow.  That's exciting.
I need to have her say... P
I need to have her tell me herself. Right? P
I have to hear it from her. P
I'm gonna kill him. No, I'm not. I feel... I... no, I'm not going to kill him. P
God! Lowest of the low. That guy. Just a notch above Toby. You know what?
Pam told me.
You're cheating. You're cheating on me. D
Nope, that's Tuesday.
I can't do Thursday. Book club. How about Friday?
How about Thursday?
Wouldn't that be fun?
I'm the mistress?
The other man. Who's the guy? Who is it? D
Toby, just do it! God!
Yes, we stab Toby through the heart with an icicle.
I don't know.
Okay geniuses, how would you do it?
I would kill Bin Laden and then Toby.
Right? And if I had a gun with two bullets and I was in a room with Hitler, Bin Laden, and Toby, I would shoot Toby twice.
You know what? We're not gonna die of radon, we're gonna die of boredom.
You're kidding me? God! You say radon is silent, but deadly, and then you expect me not to make farting noises with my mouth? What is this?
Oh! Oh wow, are those Eagles' flavors? Cake it to the Limit. That's my favorite! I love that! Too much for me to have by myself. Anybody wanna share?
Oh, thank you. It's reversible, I think.
Since when is this an office where we delve into each other's personal lives?
Okay, Pam... she's not invisible so stop asking silly questions.
Okay, well, I'll have to take a rain check, but thanks for the offer.
Oh, Hooters to go. Nice.
Well, I think we all know what you're capable of Meredith.
You know what? You know what? I am declaring a moment of silence right now. Ten minutes of silence honoring Michael Jackson. just sit there and think about Michael jackson.
Real sports with Bryant Gumble.
On her diet! He's a sports guy. He's scummy. Dogfighting. Drugs. They spit.
I'm sorry, it... why is it okay for Stanley to cheat or for Phyllis to cheat...
I will have you know that I asked Donna about this and she is fine with it. And just to be sure, I asked her again afterward. Same answer.
Yes, I am.
I am Beyonce always.
Do you think this husband is a super sweet nice guy? Do you think he's an angel? I don't think so. Why is his wife going off and having a little something-something with me? There has to be a problem with him. A
Mm, no, when are you people going to stop casting the first stone? I am not in the wrong here. I am the good guy. A
Right there. Look, look. Follow my finger. Okay? see? The grownup by the base? A
Right there. The coach!
Shh! Try not to draw attention, please. That's him. That's him.
I know, I know, I know. It--I'm--it-- that was a euphemism.
Okay, well, that's because he's paying their salary. A
You don't know. You don't-- you don't know anything. Look at him. Look at him over there. High-fiving? He didn't even do anything. Kid did all the work. I bet he does that at home. I bet it's like, "Hey, Donna, why don't you wash the dishes?" "High-five, Donna." "Hey, why don't you bring me my slippers?" "Hi-five. I'm taking all the credit."
You don't. No, no.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Shh! Okay, all right. Don't, don't.
Sorry. I got some stomach cramps.
I'm good. Oh, my God. A
No, no, no. A
I am what I am, Oscar. And I want what I want. And right now, I want a piece of cake. From now on, when I'm hungry, I am going to eat whatever I am hungry for. K
I'm awful, aren't I? K
Uh, no, they didn't say team. They just said coal Hawks. J
You love it. There ya go. J
Don't thank me. Thank Dylan's mom. Here you go! Oh! Ooh Hoo Hoo Hoo hoo!
I don't care. I have an appetite for life!  Mmm. Mmm! Oh, god. That's Lemon.
You'll learn, baby. You'll learn.
Yeah, I noticed that. C
Nobody better try to stop me. Good.
Okay, Morgan Freeman-narrating-everything.
Because a motel is dirty and it is sexy. Like me. And like Donna. And frankly, the stuff that we're into isn't very condo-appropriate.
Okay.  All right, all right. You know what? I'm sick of this. I'm sick of the little disapproving head shakes. If you think that's going to have any effect on me, it will not. I am going to leave right now and go to a motel to meet Donna.
Oh. Okay. I was talking about... what do-- what? What's going on?
Umm... I have done some very bad things, things of which I am not proud. I would like to publicly apologize to... the coach and the players. And I vow to never listen to my bodily instincts ever again.
OH! Pack Man, I thought you were a girl!
Yes. Come on! Get it up! That's what... let's do it!
Oh, that teacher who was wrongfully accused of being a pedophile. Now, we cannot let the pedophile win again! I would like you all to go to the website and watch my clip eleven times. J
Jo, Jo, I can assure you it was no one in this office.
Jo! We were not expecting you!
Yes, yes, but it shows a bigger picture.
I want these people to really pay, I want them to suffer. I'd prefer it if they died, 'cause it's not right.
Yes. You put them in jail for a long time, you put them in jail for as long as you can. J
We should give him a one-way ticket to Montego Bay, where they keep all the al-Qaeda. J
Ridiculous, Angela. And like I'm going to believe one of his spermed lovers.
Okay, I believe you, I believe you. A
That's a little much. All right, all right, all right.
I don't believe you.
About talking to the press?
Oh, god, Darryl!
Oh my god. Was she cute?
Oh, no, no, no...
I don't know what the best plan is, Pam. Oh god... my mind is going a mile an hour. P
So see you in Meredith's van in five minutes.
Hey, hey, it's as interesting as a morgue.
It's okay, she's cool, she also whistle-blew.
What do we got?
Okay. You can count on me.
That's just what we need, another black man in prison. You know, let's just...
Just don't say no.
No. Okay, not all the computers, just our computers.
I was thinking about our little leak problem. I was up all lunch thinking about what we should do to this individual. You know what I think we should do? We make 'em come to work, and we work 'em, and we make 'em sit next to all the people they screwed over. And, and we pay 'em but we make 'em feel like they did something really wrong. The one question I have is, do we give them a Christmas bonus? I say yes, it's Christmas, but right after they're back in the thick of it.
Well, deal with this.
Holly Flax from the Nashua branch. Best HR rep that Dunder Mifflin has ever seen. It's not been a blockbuster year for me financially. My Blockbuster stock is down.
And my new favorite restaurant sucks... I bought a video camera last year, and I was looking at the tapes, and there were only like twelve minutes that I felt was worth taping the whole year. And most of that was just birds in my condo complex. What is that? ... I miss Holly.
Whole year, actually. My favorite restaurant closed down.
Well, I'm going through a little bit of a rough patch.
I am not going to tell you anything.
I have rights.
I, I surely do, and don't call me honey.  You were playing too.
You know, I would be willing, under the right circumstances, to do that for you.
Okay. Hey, you could transfer Holly back from Nashua. J
Thanks. Today helped.
That was fun.
It's just coffee, guys! But, yeah, I'll look into it, okay?
He's not the worst, okay? He's not the worst. You know who's the worst? That intern we had a few years ago. That guy-remember? Eeeh! That face, how ugly he was? He was the worst. Good worker, though.  Ah! It's not cappuccino.
Okay, rude. Luke, I want you to go to the supermarket for me.
Do you think they should have had open auditions for the band Hanson? What if no one named Hanson showed up? That wouldn't even make sense. Or what if they just hired the littlest kid and a 50-year-old guy who was a murderer? Really safe.
Yes, exactly. That is a very nice way of putting it, Oscar. Mixing family and business is a beautiful thing.
Luke is my nephew.
Well, Dwight, he wiped his butt. Is that close enough for you?
Nope, it won't be Gabe but actually, there is somebody in the office that is very, very close to Luke.
Because I don't want it getting back to Sabre that we're yelling at assistants. I think it would reflect poorly on us. D
Come on. Okay, um...  That's as clear as I can make it.
That means don't. Haven't you seen Ghostbusters, Pam?
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
Because I wanted you to come to me and say, "Wow, he is so great." And I was gonna say, "Well, it's in the genes." And I was actually gonna be wearing jeans. And I'd point to them, right? No. But you ruined it. So, thank you very much. Here he comes. Guys, look. I don't want you to treat him like anyone else in the office. I just want you to treat him like my nephew. Hey, there he is. E
No, I know they fit. It's not about the fit.
Wait a minute. M
Ok, ok. You know what? This is disgusting. This is like a witch hunt. This is like the Blair Witch Hunt project. O
All right, those might be his. He might own an Ebay store.
I will cover his ass like moss on a Mississippi tree stump.
Well, this office is my pool. And my house is my house. And I just want my nephew to work in my pool.
No. No. He's my nephew. J
I love him. J
Because Gabe tattled. I was perfectly happy to just hide it from you.
All right. Are we good?  You're okay. He's okay. There are many different schools of thought on capital punishment. K
I had to do that. L
That's what you're going to do, Luke!
You are going to learn to be more professional, Luke!
Give-okay. Alright, give it up.
I'm not kidding. B
Okay, can I have that? L
All right. Okay. Good job. Okay, email accounts. So we're starting with account setup-
No, just power it down. No, no, no, no, no. Not on Angela's boob. Come on. Come on. Luke, seriously. L
Is there another option?
I can do that.
That's it? Really? That's nothing. All right. That's highway robbery.
This is the worst! You are the worst! I hate looking at your face! I wanna smash it!
So you can molest me? Oh, ok. I don't think so. We're going to leave the blinds open so every one can see what a big failure you are. That's the key.
You know, do you have any idea how angry this is making me?
One hour. We've done one hour. Let's just speed this up, ok? Keep it moving. I want to do all six hours today. T
Yeah. You know what? He took me to a baseball game once, I remember. It was weird though. They took the pitcher out of the game. I felt really bad, because the pitcher wasn't able to play with his friends anymore. But Jeff said that the manager was making a really good move, by taking the pitcher out. He really respected the manager.
Yeah, Yeah. I guess I never thought about it that way, though. T
Jeff was my mother's boyfriend, who she married.
I've played it once or twice with Jeff.
This is plenty complicated. T
You are good. But you know what? You can't help people. You couldn't help your marriage. You lose. I don't need your help. Nobody needs your help. Nobody wants it! You can't help anybody. I don't need your help! Am I going to make you cry?
Well, lets not get too... This isn't a counseling session... Ok. Son of a gun. Son of a bitch. Wow! Ok.
I guess that's why I thought he ran away in the first place. To find a kid he liked better.
I was afraid I would find him in the park, playing with another kid.
Yes, but you had me so worked up that I made a mistake. T
Really? They didn't call me. Who am I playing? ...Andy?
Nope, can't make it.
How long is it?
Andy, what time's the show?
I wish I could, Andy, but I can't. I have plans that night. I'm going to see a friend in a play called Sweeney Todd. You're that friend. I'm going to see your play. A
I can't Andy, it's too hard. That's-I put everything I had into that audition. Do you understand that?
I did, because I am being the bigger man, and balloons are bigger than flowers. P
All right, I'm sorry. God.
Are you kidding me?
Thank you. You, too.
How is that funny?Sweeney T
Okay. I appreciate the feedback. D
That would never happen. D
Well, he was getting a lot of applause, and I just didn't think it was indicative of how people were really feeling. D
Hmm? No, there were a lot of people booing you. I wasn't one of em.Sweeney T
Yeah, good job. Well done. Sweeney T
Come on, Andy, seriously.
I did not say that to make you feel good. I just said it. Total integrity.
I am not just saying that. You can trust that I am telling you the truth. I booed someone tonight. I have no filter. And if I thought you were terrible, I would have booed. And if I thought you had done a better job, I would be saying nicer things right now. But I thought that you were exactly awesome. No better, no worse.
Yeah, I get those every day after work.
Hey, what's going on here? Post-show blues? A
No, that was- I'm just getting into the first act.
You mean cancer?
It's a pimple Phyllis. Avrile Lavigne gets them all the time and she rocks harder than anyone alive.
Why at least? If you're guessing forty six just say forty six.
No! It was like four years ago!
Yeah! My last physical when I was forty.
Just a cold sore, thank you. Phyllis, I don't have acne. I have a cold sore. I don't even have a cold. I don't know how I got it.
There's no way I'm gonna do that.
Okay! You know what? Might! Might be crawling with herpes. I might have gotten it after her.
Oh my God! What if I did?
Don't even! Holly was clean! Okay? If anything I gave it to her.
You know what, I feel like one of those old timey sailors. With the eye patch.  It's me own damn fault. Woman in every port.
Yes I am telling you you have to get tested for herpes. Good-bye!
Does your stupid husband have it?
No, I am calling to see if you gave me herpes. Because if you did I would be able to avoid a lot of sucky conversations. So you have it right?
I can't even say it. H-I...
I have a disease, for which there is no known cure, that has been sexually transmitted to me.
Hi Donna. It's Michael.
Oh really? Was anyone killed?
Busted. So what can I do for you Holly.
No this is Holly.
No this is Holly.
It didn't come up organically.
Ok, alright I gotta go.
We were more than we were.
He had no arms or legs, he couldn't hear see, or speak... This is how he let a nation.
I don't romanticize th-  No...
Mhhmm! We would be married.
We would have twins.
Am I the kind of person to misremember our relationship as more than it ever was?
He hasn't changed.
Would you excuse us...
Bringing home the bacon.
I have herpes.
Ok, so I'm the guy at the station.
Am I the princess?
Because we work together.
Well, there was a little bit of a learning curve in the conversation department, but between the sheets we were like Jordan and Pippin!
I'M TRYING! GOD!
I know, I know.
Yes, I don't...
No, I'm not talking about paper. Relationships, they have the ability to point out if the man is making a bigger deal out of something that is really there.
You know, I don't know if I trust Jan's judgment. She...
Oh hey! Dwight, would you take my grandmother for a walk while I talk to Helene?
I'm Michael. We dated for a while.Old W
Just a quirky indie movie weird sort of thing, breaking all the rules. But had to end, because the summer was over. For you...
Did I make more of what we had then what was really there?
He sounds like a nice guy.
I'm great! I saw your-your sign outside. And I decided, I'm going to pull in, and maybe buy a house from her.
Carroll, how are you?
Real entertainers, like Billy Joel.
I knew what I was thinking at the time, but right now it just seems ridiculous.
Well I believe in love at first sight.
I'm between specialists right now.
Mmhmm, I'm sorry.
I just found out today. It's, uh, right there.
I have herpes.
Someone told me that I romanticize r
You put the TV here, you put the family over here.
Hi Holly it's Michael, I just wanted to call and let you know that I was thinking about what you said. It's just. You know?  It's weird. Today I ended up seeing a lot of women that I used to date, and in my mind they were all great. And then when I actually saw them, it was mostly a freak show. And you and me, that must have been a real train wreck. You know what, Holly? You're wrong. You are wrong. I remember every second of us. And talking to them today, I don't feel for them anything like what I feel for you. I didn't joke with any of them, I joked with you. You are the only one who was actually happy to hear from me. And I don't know why you downgraded what we had but I did not make us up. Ok.  Oh, wait, and you should talk to a doctor because you might have herpes. Bye.
Oscar! Think abou- Think!
An electric car dealership.
Moolit Gandala, carrage drive through Central Park...
Flower shops, fireworks celebrations...
I have already contacted all of my ex-lovers except for you.
You may have given me a sexually transmitted disease.
Oscar, we once sucked face in public. As part of an office presentation to destroy the stigma of gay kissing. Do you recall?
Oh, look at that.   Smooth roll.
She is a beaut!
Ow!  You never forget. Whoo!
Oh, my god!
I did, yes! I had those extra wheels on the back...that support you.  Mi-chael! Mi-chael!
No! Okay.  All right.
No, I don't have time for this. Are you kidding me?
I will see you in ten. Bye! Hold tight.  Well, I know a lot of you thought that my sales days were behind me, and to be honest, so did I...and the only reason I got out of the sales game was to be reluctantly called back in.
You need the big guns, yes?
It's Jim, Okay? Yes.
Oh, hey. No, I'm not busy. What's up?
It's showtime! Oh...never mind. Let's go.
Okay, you know-all right, just forget it then.
Oh, thank you. All right. On the count of three, it's showtime. Ready, one, two--
Buh-bye. I could swear that guy was a male model.
Yeah, well...we call it overkill. Why am I telling you my strategy?
Nice to meet you.
That...hello. Michael Scott, Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company.
Oh, no, that's a male model.
Okay. Thank you.
Shake it, shake it!
And you know what else we're gonna do? I can't believe I'm gonna say this...we are going to offer you our paper at cost. I know. I could get in a lotta trouble for this, so you'd better shake my hand right now.
You know what? You are having some problems with your loading dock, are you not? All right. We're going to deliver to you on weekends.
Stop it. Just stop it. We did what we should have done, we just got bested.  Why is there a door close button if it doesn't even close the door?
Oh, my god!
I don't know, your frame, your build-why don't you have a glass of apple juice and tell me you're not a diabetic.  See? I could tell by the sound you made when you stood up that you have-okay. Yes, Phyllis?
Why don't you go outside and...take a shot of insulin and have a nap, okay?
Okay. You know what? You clearly don't care, so why don't you just leave?
Paul Newman, Robert Redford. They're bank robbers.
Like the movie.
You know what this is? This is a stinger.
Shhh! Hey! That's my mug.
Oh...my god! He's making her sell to him.
Pull it together, all right? Stop lookin' at him.
Yeah, he is that good-looking.
Oh, no, no. No. Don't-
Don't let us down.
I can give you more money-there's your better life. I can let you come and go as you please-there's your freedom. And you already know Dunder-Mifflin has the best service and the best prices, but you beat us anyway. Can you imagine how well you would do selling our stuff?
Do you want more freedom, less freedom, or to stay the same?
I know, I know.
Answer the question. Do you want a better life, Danny?
Hold it, hold it.  Hold on, hold on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Wait. Danny, I want you to look at me. Do you want your life to be better...or to be worse or to stay the same?
So, you will?
You are, you are. You are! Stop it, stop it. Stop.  You are a good salesman. And because of that...I want you to work for me.
No, we don't. Here's-here's my point. Danny, listen, you have to understand that we are not normally like this. We just-we wanted to know your tricks.
Okay. You know what, it wasn't just me. Jim and Dwight are behind that wall in the surveillance room and it was their plan as well.
Yes. And it's the sincerest form of flattery.
A surveillance room next to this one.
I owe you...a most sincere and humble apology. We were trying to watch you to see your sales technique, so we could stop losing so many clients to you.
Don't! Get away from him. Please, just leave. Get out of here. Go. Forever.
I said stop. Okay, Danny...this is not Pennsylvania Solartech. This is Dunder-Mifflin Paper Company. This is Meredith Palmer-
Stop, stop! Oh, my god!  Okay. Stop it, stop it, stop it. Gross! Stop it, please. Everybody, stop.
I'm goin 'in!
No, no, no....
He doesn't need to sit, he's a traveling salesman. Look, I am not going to exclude good people from our staff simply because they are threatening to you. And unless you have a better argument than that, I suggest you leave.
No, no. Wrong. He would have stolen your clients, but you know what? He can't now. This guy used to steal sales from us; now, he's going to steal sales for us.
Okay. Well...get ready, 'cause it's gonna get better.
Guys, let me ask you something. Do you want your life to be better or worse or stay the same?
Okay. Let's-all right, all right. Let's talk. Please don't let him leave.  Don't leave. Don't let him.
I said no.
No, you may not.
No, me. Right? Sorta like...a little younger version of me.
No. No. No. Somebody in this office.
O-kay. You know what? No. No. This is not some sort of construction site...or all of Italy, where you can just go around treating people like meat. We are to respect him. I respect him because he reminds me of somebody. Can anybody guess who that is?
OH! Who likes to water ski on Lake Erie? No wai-where does Dracula like to water ski?
So, wait, drivers are going to be able to sell paper on the road?
Oh. It's a ream of paper. Thought you might hit me.
Really? We're good?
Oh, so... I almost forgot. You'll find this hilarious. Apparently corporate is going to have drivers sell paper on their routes now. That's like, exactly sort of the idea that you had.
And we are going to straighten this out.
I got in the way. I said no. And it just stopped. But then corporate comes up with this idea, but you know what? They need to know that it was yours. And I don't care if I take a bullet. We're gonna call them, we're gonna put them on speakerphone right now...
This whole delivery slash sales idea? You know whose idea that was? That was Darryl Philbin's. He thought of that way before the corporate fat suits.
Yeah, I bet it is! If you're gonna do your job well here, you gotta get used to being embarrassed.
You need to stop being so shy, come out here, and embrace who you really are, superstar!
Hi, Darryl, come out here, please.
No, he didn't go behind my back. He went over my head.
Well, don't let it happen again.
What did you just thought? K
Oh, you're sorry? K
Do you think that Kevin is going over my head? I don't- Oh my GOD. Okay. All right. All right. You know what? That's inappropriate, Kevin. I am your boss, and if you have something to say, it goes through me, and then I take it to Gabe. Chain of command. Do you understand?
What the hell are they talking about?
Is it? D
So that's it.
In front of me.
Okay, that might help. If you said "I'm sorry" in front of everybody.
You went over my head. And then you lied to my face. So my head and my face have taken a beating.
Yeah, I gotta get in on this.  Hey, it's cool, man, I work in the warehouse! I'm cool! I'm hip and I'm jive! And I don't care about nobody! Do you know who I am? Happy Halloween, jerk!
NEVER!  Okay, you know what? Fine.  I'm not Darryl. And thank God I'm not Darryl.
What's a bad idea?
Dwight, you saw Darryl move it, right?
Aaah! Darryl moved it. You moved it.
Hey, can I play? Why don't you ask if Darryl is a bad friend who backstabs people in the back?
Sorry I was a jerk.
Unless you and I decide we want to talk to Jo, then we'll give her a call.
Okay. We both reserve the right to go to Jo if we disagree with Gabe.
I am not budging on the hat issue.
You don't have to point to the fact that we're thinking about it. Stop it! Just let us think. Okay, next time you have a really great idea, we will put it in a hat, and then we will have Erin pick it out of the hat and let her decide.
Stop it! Stop, stop. We're thinking. We're thinking about it.
That was-okay, you make one mistake in fifteen years and you drag me over the coals, after everything I did for you?
Um... kay. Uh, alright.
That's true, that's true. I dated her momma, and you know what-
Oh, yes.  Doobie-doobie doo.
No, I have plenty of friends, so... all right, well, you have great seats. Enjoy the show.
Okay. Old friend, like, you've known him since kindergarten?
So who is the godfather?
I'm not the godfather.
Scooch. Before I shoot you in the head.
Are you talking to me?
But I'm the Godfather.
Good morning.Female church member : Good morning.
Thank you. You too.
No, I insist. After me.Male church m
You know what, guys, let's just enjoy lunch.
Are you kidding me? Stop it.
Hey, Dwight. Dwight, hey.
No. Okay, you know what? This is inappropriate. What is wrong with you guys? What is wrong with you? What is so horrible about wanting to get together and do something nice? Why did you guys even come today? What's so great about your lives that you think you're better than everybody else? That you can make fun of everybody else? You're mean. You're mean girls. Like the movie, Mean Girls. And Kevin and Stanley, if you don't stop worrying so much about what you're gonna put in your gullet, you're gonna die in about a month.
Well, it's, it's-
Look at these people. These are church-going people. And they know how to party.
Yeah, well, that's just a pick-up scene. Okay, we don't have to volunteer. But I think we should hang out more together.
Really?  Thank you. All right.
If you'll have me, yes.
I'll take a shirt.
No, you may not.
Tell them that I'm in a meeting.
Tell them that I died, and I turned into an angel, and when they feel a breeze in a room with all the windows closed or that-that chill on the back of their neck, that is just me watching over them.
You know what, my job will be here when I get back.
It is not irresponsible! I have never been more confident about a decision in my life.
No, I'm not. I'm staying on the bus. I'm already on the bus. I'm going.
Well, you know what, everybody thinks that I am crazy, and that tells me that I am the sanest person I know. So... A
Mm. That's not gonna happen.
No, we-No. You know how these things go. Construction projects, they say three months, and then, after two years, the lazy bums haven't even started. Now we're those lazy bums. I gotta get off this bus.
And Cinco de Mayo.
Oh, God, you know what? I'm gonna be in Mexico for my half-birthday.
What is happening? Oh, God, what is happening?
Carla knows. Oh, I feel like there were so many more people on this bus. There were, like, 200, 300 people before. Hey, Carla? Carla? Hi. What are you doing?
Do we know how? I don't know how. You know how?
Ooh. What are we building down there again? Like, a hospital? A school for Mexicans? What?
How long till we get to Mexico?
Okay, well, a pleasure. Go save the world. We'll keep an eye on America for you.Another g
Do you want that for little Jessica? No, you don't. And the answer is clear. Stop the bus. Okay?
We could go back and forth all day. It's not gonna solve anything.
I didn't sign up for this. You guys are young, that's great. You want to give back to society. I've done that. I need to take.
Stop the bus, okay?
Yeah, just get him to stop the bus, please.
Do that. Do it.
It is so nice to be back in a country that has movies.
What? Shut up.
Is anyone still at the church?
They have him surrounded. It's the SWAT. The SWAT's arriving.
Ok, that's our street! That's our street! He's going down our street!
You know who my favorite character is? The invalid.  I am coming to your party.
I'm joking. I'm kidding around! I'm not actually angry.  I'm not busy at all, I'm not doing anything. And I know what Glee is, I'm a total Gleek.
MMM MMM MM MM MM! Did you hear what I said? I'm a very busy man. I don't have time for your TV show.
Cancel it! Are you still here?  E
Dwight! Sign please. I don't have time for parties I don't have time for TV shows. Stanley! What time is that thing I have to do?
Glee? What is Glee, some television program? Jim I need that thing stat!
Walk with me.
Yeeee... Guys! Do you consider Gabe to be the boss?
Why did you just say he was the boss?
What? No Gabe is... Gabe is not the boss.
Yes, I am. Are you?
Okay okay okay.
Okay...  Heeeere's what we're gonna do! Right down the hall is a bed room. All the real Glee fans are gonna go down the hall to the real Glee party in the bedroom, follow me! Where we can crank it!
Well I will turn up the volume.
Well some of us are trying to have a...
Actually I think it's not loud enough. May I? Thank you sah!  There we go. Glee right? Rock and roll! Turn it up to elevaan! Spinal Cord!
Where's Michael? Where's Michael? We can't start without Michael! Oh here he is! Ohhhh. Yayyy, and let the show begin!
Pam I have a loaded gun in my desk at work. If I ever start acting like that weenie Gabe I want you to take that gun, and I want you to shoot me like a hundred times in the groin until I'm dead. Okay?
You know what Erin you do have to.
He's the longest baby in this room.
So these are pizza dogs, they aren't pigs in a blanket per se.
Is this the same dough you used for the pizza crust?
Yeah, well I wasn't very hard to find.
Boy I wish I could see that. You know what? I have an idea. I don't know if it's gonna work, but let me give it this. Okay, I'm gonna give it shot.
Now that's going on?
Are you kidding me?
What does that mean? Party's over? Everybody leaves? Are you sure?
What? Really? That stinks!
I just went out for a walk.
Gahh, I will pull this car over!
Oh do not raise your voice to me!
As long as you are living under this roof you are going to do what I say.
You listen to me. You listen good. You are are not, to see that boy, anymore.
Go to your room young lady!
Go to your room.
Why? I'm not your father.  All right.
What is there to like? He's just, he's a weird little skeevy guy with no waist, why do you care whether we like him or not?
No I was just check- Yeah. Yes I did, yeah yeah.
If you break that girl's heart, I will kill you. It's just a figure of speech. But seriously, if you break that girl's heart I will literally kill you and your entire family.
The important thing is... this kept us secure people.
You know what? It made me laugh when I heard it, but Pam got really offended.
Okay, moving backwards, our I.T. Guys have been...  Glasses, Turban, Ear Hair, Fatty 3, Shorts, Fatty 2, Lozenge, and Fatso. I think Lozenge was the one who installed it.
Uh... try "password".
A what? R
I sent you a Facebook message yesterday, I still haven't heard anything back. R
That does sound fun to me. R
Don't you work here full-time?
You and me.
Your kidding?! R
Wuphf! All right, I've warmed them up for you. You have the floor, Ryan.
No, not this weekend; next weekend. We were gonna go on the investors ski trip. I bought poles.
Wait, Ryan, so this could be over by the weekend?
No, it's not weird, Andy, and you know what else? We have an offer from Washington University. So monetize that. K
"He's up there."
"It's Ryan the WUPHF guy!"
I--yes. We're not selling. I will not sell.
I won't sell. And you know what? Ryan and I have the majority of shares. Isn't that right?
I thought it might make me feel better. P
I'm just saying that I think I agree with your point.
You may be right. I may be crazy.
I think you are wrong.
Right, Yes, yeah. Best friend/mentor.
No, I won't even consider it.
We Don't? Well, why have I been separating the trash into whites and colors?
Can't talk, saving the planet.
Oh right. What am I saying? Rain Check.
Yeah, well, we never even have dinner now, so... R
So you would think that's a good idea for me to do?
Maybe I could take a second mortgage on my condo.
Yes, you have tapped this. Hard.
Nine days, though. That's, like... R
Always have your back. So, any ideas on how we can get over this nine-day hump here?
Good, good, bro.
You can't have it.
Only if he fails. And you know what? Ryan, I believe in you. Just like I believe in all of you. You have nine days to save everybody's money.
I'm not blind! I know exactly who he is. He is selfish and lazy and image-obsessed, and he is a bad friend.  And he's also clever. And he shoots incredibly high. And he may just make it. But you know what? Even if he doesn't, I would rather go broke betting on my people, than get rich all by myself, on some island like a castaway. And there is no middle ground. A
I. Do not agree to sell, which is to say nay.
I found that in the waiting room at the dentist's office. This kid had the magazine I wanted to read, that's the only one I could reach and I read it and then I read it again.
Yeah, right here. It is right there.  Anybody read the news any more?
They used to make stuff in America, Andy. But we're falling behind, did you know that? China is a sleeping dragon that is just beginning to stir.
Everything here was made in China, Pam.
It was great. China.
I know what we're going to do. We're going to put our best minds on it.
So much for keeping our secrets up high.
I don't know.
Once a week antacid is the idea to beat. Anyone else? Nobody? Okay then we are... yes.
Yes, indeed. Yes Kevin.
How do we stop it? With a big idea. That's what America is built on, big ideas. Blue jeans, the Grand Canyon. Whose got one, whose got a big idea?
Welcome to your future.
I got it from NewYorkTimes.
No, no you're wrong about this.
In terms of land, not population.
No, no. That is right now. O
No he's not right. We're not. Where would we even drop it, Phyllis? Did you know that in China there are fifty six cities with over a million people? You know how many we have here? Nine.
Absolutely, Pam this is exactly why I hired you as Office Administrator, handle it. Taking care of business.
Not if the printer isn't hooked up. You are making some very dangerous assumptions Oscar.
Try 'Control P'.
Very comedically humorous Jim.
I'm pretty good on politics. "California is bankrupt, and California, California."  What?
Alright, well I just need to learn everything about China. To be safe I should learn everything about everything but I don't have time. Okay, okay, I'll just learn about China and science and geography and math and literary.
I don't need to cheat.
Is it going to be worth it?
Wait, wait, wait. How long is this going to take?
I could talk about boobs. I bet he knows nothing about boobs.
Did you also know that China has secretly been expanding its nuclear arsenal. But what do I know, I mean, that's just according to the Pentagon. Our Pentagon.
Did you know, that China has a new missile, that can sink a US Naval Carrier nine hundred miles off the coast?
How then do you explain that in the past year manufacturing in China has risen by 17% and in the US it has only risen by 8%?
Raise your cups on high. Case closed. O
I am talking about freedom, about choice. America, I don't think you need to worry. Because if you want to beat China you will. If you don't, that's fine. That my friend, is your victory. Y'know, a lot of people say if you dig long enough and hard enough you will get to China, and that may be the true, but what they don't tell you is that if you dig long enough and hard enough in a conversation, you get to a friend. So here is to conversation.
My point is... that as long as people like you and me don't stop talking, nobody can stop the USA.
Here we are.
This chat. Two men, one white, one latina. A boss and a money cruncher. I could fire you.
Wait. You forgetting something?
Yeah, I figured that.
We didn't get it.
I believe in us. We can do this. Here we go.
Don't answer that. People, listen up and listen good. We need to just get one picture where we're all in the air at the same time. Yes?
Okay, everybody jump in the air this time, please. Here we go.
That's it! That's a picture! Yes! Jump in the air. We're gonna jump in the air. Here we go.
People, wait, wait, wait. Come back, come back. One fun one. We're gonna do a fun one.
Well, that's a relief. Santa's gonna take some much-needed free time. Alright. Good!
Alright. Well, I will be in my office making toys for the good children. Andy?
So Stanley, how big is the bug up your butt today?
Good for you. Angela, lay it on me. What's the problem?
No? Good. Did anyone get drunk already?
Are we over budget?
How's the party coming along?
How's everybody doing today?
You know what, I'll pay for it. I'll pay for the party. It doesn't matter. This is way too important. People, Holly's coming back, and this is the most important Christmas party of my life. So back to work.
Well then everybody'll chip in, it'll be fine.
It's not. They're not. Fresh and new. Please let go. Please let go.
No, no, no, we're gonna get fresh for Holly. Fresh and new.
No, we have to cancel the party.
Cancel. We're canceling it.
You know what, we'll postpone this party until then. This is too important. Cancel this one. Dwight get rid of the tree.
Holly's coming back, everybody, and we have to have a party.
That is a great question, Erin. How do you describe somebody who is at the same time an old friend, and was a lover, and was a complicated part of my past, and maybe, just maybe a part of my future?
Hold on, Holly's coming back here?
Okay. Okay goodbye, goodbye.
That was the worst joke ever.
You know what you, you, you leave these huge pauses in your sentences. What do you expect me to do?
Yes, the case of the horrible red-headed sad sack. And the verdict, it was Toby. And the sentence, death. Death to Toby!
Uh, because you've been on the Lam? Because the 'boring police' have been after you, and they finally caught up with you?
Well, then he's not a senator.
Could he help us with some parking tickets?
You never know about the press.
Well, this year's gonna be different. We're gonna have fun. It's not gonna be tacky. It's going to be, you know what, the food is going to be austere. It is not going to be tacky, deli platter food. It's not gonna have a big, fat, gross Santa Claus. It's gonna be cool, sleek Santa.
Yes, that's me. Come on it.
Pam, no, no. Holly's coming from New Hampshire. Somebody from New Hampshire looks at that and thinks it's a burning cross. No, no. I want you to go and get a real tree. Take some money. Thank you.Bass P
What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be in the courthouse.
She doesn't need an internet presence, you just know.
And then he will come back here and replace Holly, so stop asking him questions.
What kind of guns do you have? Six-shooter?
Isn't it wonderful? We love it here. Don't you love it? All right, let me show you to your desk.  I show you to your desk.
Well, you came on the day of our Christmas party.
Oh no, not the huggy monster! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die!  Wow. Well, everybody, you remember Holly.
Hi. Hi. Oh...
Nyuk, nyuk, nyuk, nyuk!
Why, you're some sorta wise guy, huh?
Well, I never thought I'd see your face around these parts, you old bastard.
There she is. Hey. Erin, would you help her, for God's sake?
Yeah, Randy Newman's the best.
Oh, you do?
Really? That's creepy. How did AJ get in your house?
Good for him.
Get a... yeah! Good riddance.
What a douche bag!
You're kidding me. Ahh!
Because without Andy's mom, there's no plot. And without any plot, there is no movie.
You know who my favorite character in Toy Story is? Andy's mom.
Well, that's understandable. Still raw. Woody your favorite character?
Oh, and you have a Woody. Bah!  Oh, I love toy... H
Nora Ephron, in every romantic comedy ever made.
Yeah, well, I was told that Holly would be here, single and ready to date. And we all got misled.
It's a sophisticated take.
Hey there, Jada. Nice to see you again. I'm Santa Claus. Welcome.
I do. She is.
I'm a man in my mid-40s and I still get zits. I think that's pretty interesting. But you know what? I am not on trial here. The Scranton strangler is. So, anyway, we have this great weekend, and she drives me to the airport, and we get to JFK, but I am flying out of LaGuardia. So we laugh and laugh and laugh, and then we spend the rest of the day walking around Slo-mo, drinking latte. And at the end of the day, she gives me this, and she says, "Michael, maybe next time, you should take a cab."
I haven't told you about her.
All this arguing reminds me of a very funny story. You see this on my desk?  Know who gave me this? My girlfriend Tara, who lives in New York City.
What if Meredith was taking her smoking break below that window? You know what would have happened? The shards of glass would have shaved her face right off. And, yes, it might have been funny. But it also would have been incredibly tragic.
And we did this whole stupid party for you.
When you got transferred, and I drove you up to Nashua, you said, "Michael, I love you, but I can't do this." But then, with this other guy, you don't have any problem with a long-distance relationship, do you? And you know what, that is what is the matter with me.
Oh, really? You certainly seemed jealous when I told you about my fake girlfriend. That's what Jim and Dwight thought.
All right. Shh. Okay, you know what? Holly, I didn't mean to do it. It was an accident. An accident borne of jealous feelings.
I don't. But someday I think we will laugh about this... when we tell our kids...
Ahhhhhh!  Surprise! It was part of the party. Pretty funny, huh?
Mmhmm. Mmhmm. Well, the fact that you would think that points to the possibility that it is probably not me. And that I have been framed.
It is Christmas.
Oh, really? Turn it on me. Well, isn't that nice? Thank you very much.
What happened? What happened? Toby, what did you do? I think Toby's very jealous of all the attention you've been getting.
Mmm. Erin, would you do me a favor and find my street clothes for me, please?
Good, good. Good to see you. Have fun. Enjoy the partay.
Good trip down?
Nice to see you again, AJ. Welcome.
Yeah. I mean, I can wait till then. Come here. I don't want you to fall.
Yeah, well, at least he was married.
Yup. I read this story about a woman who slipped on some black ice, and she hit her head and went into a coma forever. And then every day, her husband went and visited her in the hospital until she died.
Oh, hey, hey, no, don't run. You're gonna slip.
Well, that... K
From the mall. That...
No, that's not... no, I went to the mall and I picked that out especially for you.
I think I know where he is.
Oh, you know, I seem to remember that Santa promised that he would listen to all the gifts you wanted for Christmas. Didn't he say that?
Thank you. A Hostess apple pie! This is my favorite breakfast. How did you know that? Thank you very much.
All right. You have to pick up after them.
You, are you sure you don't want a pony? You want a real horse?
Okay, so killing yourself.  I was just thinking about snot.
I did! I did, indeed. Two front row center, to Paula Poundstone, Live in Poughkeepsie. Holly's favorite. I hope she doesn't call us up on stage. That would suck. "Hey, you think you can do my job better?" I don't know. "What's your name?" Michael.
Both sad. E
For you, job well done.
Sad, something to break.
Bears sad, worms happy. Come on, Erin.
Sad. To soak up my tears.
Yes, no, why? Stop! Yes.
They're so fuzzy and warm! Let me feel those. Let me feel that. Put 'er there. Give me a good firm... ooh! That's a good firm handshake. You're hired! Yes, let's get right into the Anderson account, shall we? Yes, yes, right away.
So... high five me. We're back. To a happy...  look at those! Mittens. Are those a present?
Oh my God!
I'm good. E
Go! Oh, that's nice.Video M
I'm trying! Video M
I still have my old phone. This thing... indestructible.
E.T. phone Holly. Holly like phone?
That is neat. H
That's true. She's really nice. She'd talk to anybody. Why don't you bring Erin to balance you out?
You think she'd talk to you?
No. She'd just resent me. Or worse! She would think of me as her friend.  Oh, hi friend! Blegh.
Do you love him now?
But you did still love him.
When you broke it off with Roy, did you still tell him you loved him?
No! You can't have any candy!
Let me see if you swallowed it, open your mouth. Under your tongue.  Oh, God! You guys are pathetic. K
All right, all right, shh!
I don't care whether you hate it! You said you'd do it! A
No. No cheese whiz, no hollandaise, no chocolate sauce, just eat it. Come on. Here comes the airplane, there you go. Open, open, into the hanger, there you go.
Just do a cartwheel!
You're just gonna somersault around for the rest of your life and you know what's going to be on your tombstone?  Loser.
What is wrong with you people? Can't you stick to anything? Erin, I want you to go to the kitchen and get me some vegetables. Creed, you say you want to do a cartwheel? Nothing's stopping you. Come on, old man, do a cartwheel!
Next year? Come-I mean, what is the point? What is the point of that? I made a resolution to floss, and I did it. 12:01, January first, BAM! Blood everywhere.
Well, I just want to talk about what happened in there. H
Not Michael, E.T.
Okay, oh! All right.
I really wanted you to follow through on your resolutions. The cartwheel, the veggies... I... care about you. Very much. And you loom so large in my heart that I crossed the line. K
It was insensitive and I am sorry.
And I wanted to apologize. These resolutions should be about you, and I made it about me, and it was none of my beeswax. K
You can toss them.
Congratulations. All right. Well, all right. See you tomorrow.
It's about you. It's about you. Go!
You know what? I'm going to stay here as long as it takes.
You ready to do this?
Dunder Mifflin. D
I do Ping. Herrow. I Ping! D
Michael Scott. D
Hello, I am here for the small business seminar. E
Let's go. J
Why does the sun rise in the morning? Why do magnets stick together? Because everybody says so. Everybody. H
You broke up with AJ weeks ago. H
Just a minute. How long do we have to wait?
Yeah, I do. My word against yours. J
Okay, fine. My feelings don't matter to you. What matters to you is your precious speed limit. J
I am not. I just have had a bad day.  And I... okay. I'll be back later with the money. I'm just gonna leave right now. W
Well I can, but I will have to come back later tonight and pay you. But the point is I did the right thing.
Yeah.  Wow. I just miss you so much. H
Are you... are you sick, Oscar? Do you need to go home? 'Cause you're grossing me out. O
Are these numbers correct? O
Oh, yeah. H
Yes. Michael Scott, Dunder Mifflin. What is the purpose of this meeting?
What? Problem solved.
I am really disappointed in the office's policy on PDA at this moment. I love you.
I love you-love you. H
Clean up on aisle five. [Threat L
Leave it at reception.
That's... That's. Well, don't put words in my mouth.
Sweet, I will go invite Holly.
It's got a lot of me.
Mhmm! It's got action, it's got heart, it's got some bosom.
Goldenface, this makes it personal.
Tell him I'm retired.
Well, it looks like there's going to be a clean-up on aisle five.
What am I supposed to do with this?Cherokee J
I'm not here to learn how to mop, I'm here to learn how to play hockey.Cherokee J
Nice try Goldenface, but you forgot one thing, to kill me.
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
I am sorry that I have to do this...
Not who, what. The Funky Cat is the hippest Jazz Club in town.
Go puck yourself!
Why are you telling me this?
He said, where is the bomb?
The joke's on you Goldenface, that man was a wanted animal rapist.
It'll take a lot more than a bullet to the brain, lungs, heart, back, and balls to kill Michael Scarn.
For the insurance money! I knew it all along!
Don't ever change Billy. Goldenface is going to blow up the NHL All Star Game tomorrow.
I got problems Billy. Big problems...
You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn! You jump to the right and you shake a hand and you jump to the left and you shake that hand. You meet new friends, and tie that yarn, and that's how you do The Scarn!Todd P
No Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died.
Okay.  No, it's not good enough. It's not good enough...
Pretty cool, right? Did you like it? Did you like that?
Did you? What did you love about it?
Mmmm, good? Everybody out there says it's great!
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass. And I'm gonna go watch the movie with people who think it's great! And I'm sorry I called you a pain in the ass, I'm angry, and I love you.
I have my book on business, Somehow I Manage. I have my HBO comedy special, Here I Go Again dot-dot-dot. But you know what? When I think about it, when I really think about it, none of those things are as real to me as my movie.
Because, if I don't have this, what do I have? I have nothing.
I talk about a lot of things, Holly! I was eventually gonna get around to my dream! Obviously! Eleven years I could've been working on the Scarn Nebulus.
It was eleven years, okay? This has been my dream for eleven years, and if you don't think it's great than you're basically saying that you don't believe in my dream.
Is it, is it because you're afraid of where this is gonna take me? See, because I need you... to keep me grounded.
I know, it's a good thing my trainer and mentor is here to cheer me on!
No, no! Actually it's really screwed up because they
No it's not.  It's not. But, they really seem to be enjoying it.
Ugh...  I'm in.
No, no Dwight. He's just being stupid.
Oh yeah!  Yes he is!      D
Still not seeing the problem here.
You did! You got burned, because Packer's back! Packer is turning in his car for a desk. He is turning in his condoms, for a condominium! Although he's probably going to have to use condoms from here on out.
Yes! The Pack is back! Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce you to a man who needs no introduction, probably because most of you have done it with him. Just kidding he wouldn't be interested in any of you. In all seriousness, Todd Packer, is a permanent salesman at this branch. And I would like to invite you to welcome him with open arms.
Don't know, don't care.
Is Packer here?
And it also helps if you've had five shots.
Oh, yes yes yes yes. Just so you know, he's at his funniest when you've given him five shots. H
Oh, Michael! This'll be just us.
Don't be a baby! Okay! There it is. Packer was here and so was your mom! [Todd starts humping Dwight and Michael who are still under the desk.
Let's look at this.
So you wouldn't mind permanently relocating, so that Packer can take this desk here.
And I don't have anything for you. But I do wanna talk to you about something. We have been thinking about where Packer should sit... And we can't just sit around and wait for Creed to die.
So I'm less funny than not funny at all?
He's funnier than me.
Whoa! Look, are you jealous of him? Because you think he's funnier than you? Oh honey...
No. Not me, him.
Yeah, You love him right?  You love him. I can tell.
Question, should I get stripes shaved on the side of my head?
Best day ever. Best day ever!
Yeah, a little bit.
No it isn't.
You've been on the road a long time. And you've been an outdoor cat. And now you have to be an indoor cat, so you can't be peeing all over the walls.
I guess you said something weird about your daughter?
I don't know, Holly mentioned that there were some complaints. And that you had said some things about Kevin.
And you made Hank smile, that doesn't happen often. You're very charming. That is something you should take upstairs, and use on people that really matter.
I was going to say dogs! Okay, you know what, this is over! Apology has been issued! And we're through with it. Packer will be here until the day he dies, just like the rest of us!
That-That was maybe too much. Packer is a survivor of divorce Stanley. Packer doesn't speak with his child, Meredith. Packer never lived up to his parent's expectations, Andy.  Angela loves pussy cats, and Packer loves-
Okay, go back to the annex.
Kevin, do you accept the apology?
Okay, sweetie, no. You shouldn't be apologizing to Packer. That doesn't make any sense. You ready for this? You ready for this? Gentlemen, start your engines.
Kevin, we know that you are just trying to save face, we know that you are hurt and embarrassed.
He is my oldest friend, I am going to tell him.
You have to tell him. You have to tell him what you did.
Okay, so you're tricking him into flying to Florida?
I cannot believe this, you're sending Packer to Florida? Why?
That is.  It's gonna be awesome. I think you're really going to enjoy it down there.
No, nothing like that at all. T
Well... I don't know if that's a good idea.
No you ahh.
I don't have an in case. Do you have an in case?
In case... in case of what?
You know it's really more for a bachelor pad. I just want to get a fair price.
That is how you do it.
Mhmm, no I paid 500 dollars for that.
I uh... I actually don't know why I brought that because It's kind of priceless.
No, this is romantic.
Hey you know what? I've got gas all over my hands and my shoes. Would you light it? Would you do the honors please?
I'm asking Holly a question in fire.
Well, I'm writing a message.
Oh, you know what, you have a siphon? I think I'm gonna run out of gas.
I had a great idea until you ruined it.
No, no, no, no. My minds made up I am not going to change my mind you can't talk me out of it.
Yes. Thank you.
I could not have agreed with you more.
I know but I'm still scared I don't know why.
Oh yea you didn't say that the weather was bad that sounds perfect. I want this to be an event that everyone talks about always and forever.
That mush have been a surprise when... at the gas station you proposed.
At a gas station? J
Is she not going to like that?
Yeah. I saved 3 years salary.
Heres the ring.
It's easy enough to get a corpse, you just go to a med school. I already have the ring.
No, no, shhhhut it. Mhmm. Oh God. Nope, nope, nope.
Yeah, yeah well you definitely need to do that.
Is he alright?
Oh ok. For how long?
Ok it's because we haven't sold anything. You know what? We just wait until the end of the day, people get desperate, and they're gonna pay anything.
Shhhh. Let's go on a little walk. You know what? I wanna show you some stuff.
No, no, no, no, lets not talk about that.
This is where Toby announced that he was going to Costa Rica. Happiest day of my life. Until the day you came to replace him. Let's go in here.
And this is where we first made love. Remember what I tried there?
And right over there is where you found out that Meredith was prostituting herself for Outback steak. And I will never forget that you had the cutest look on your face because you couldn't believe it, you thought it was so wrong.
We saved a lot of lives that day. That's where you first met Michael Klump.
Well, nothing. Nothing really. I would just find an excuse to come here so I could stare at you through that window. This is what I'd do.
Holly has to go back to Colorado. I'm going with her. I'm leaving.
Thank you. So guys, guys, guys. We're moving to Colorado.
Holly Flax, marrying me will you be?
Only one that I was kind of worried about.
That would be hot. I would pay to see that.
That marriage would be a sham.
That guy's got more than he can handle as it is.
This is where our love faces its toughest test. After this, its just smooth sailing for the rest of our lives.
Oh yeah? Me too. Summer or winter?Deangelo/
That's what I've heard.
You know, I would like to try the luge, through.
Yep. Don't mess with Colorado. D
I'm moving out to the burbs... actually, I'm moving further than the burbs, I'm moving to Colorado.
Do not tell my fiance I'm drinking on a Wednesday. D
Actually, I am meeting somebody, but I'm a little bit early. Leaving my company. After 19 years.
Wow... that is insane!  D
I see your voice in the phone. Oh, man!  Michael Scott.
I hear your voice.
Are we both at the right place?
What're you wearing?
I'm been here about... gosh, over half an hour.
I... do not see you.
You are? What bar?
No, I'm here. I'm right... I'm at the bar. D
Man, he is late. I'm gonna call him. Do you mind? I'm sorry.
Oh... wow. The mountains. Where things are.
Really? What happened?
I am well, sir, how are you?
Oh yeah... I know... that's what I was just saying... that's what...
I happen to like the hilarious hijinx I get myself into. There he is! Deangelo, I was just telling them about last night, when we met. Remember that? That was crazy!
Yes it was.
You know me very well, Dwight.
Are you kidding? I'd come anywhere to see a turtle? Where'd you find him.
You can do the old way or whatever you think would work.
Well, whatever. Whatever you think will work.
I know, I know, I'm sorry, but if it's not a big deal we should just-
I sorta like the old way.
Don't shave my lips.
Ok, you know what, I mark it urgent A, urgent B, urgent C, urgent D. Urgent A is the most important, urgent D you don't even really have to worry about.
You know what, everybody? You have to be honest, here. You can't say that everything is perfect. So, you know, come up with something.
Well, we don't really do rap sessions. We kinda do...  god... we sorta do more of like powwows or-
It really does. This is luxery. Here we go. Ah, that is nice.
And this is Erin and she is going to shave my face. Here we go.  D
This is going to be funny! Looks like we are going to be shaving buddies!
I still have to look at this stuff, guys.
You know, this office sort of has a perfect Feng Shui to it, so... you know, let's not go overboard with the re-decorating, and I'm still here-
You'll figure it out.
No, no, no. Come on. You are good, they know it.
Ok.  Why did you have to be so damn good?
I start with some chit-chat and a maybe a couple of jokes. And you might want to develop a couple of characters. You know what, you'll be fine.
Well, who needs him. Guess it's just you and me, Dwight.
No, it's not insane, Oscar. I'm been here for 19 years, and just because someone else is called the boss, you're gonna throw it all away? No. J
No one had a problem with the air here until you came around.
Oscar, here you go.
I think Kevin wants one. Kevin, here you go!
PB and J, my mom's recipe!
Snack time! It's the witching hour! It's the sandwitching hour!
Why do you always say that? You're gonna love it.
Every year! This happens, you have a lot to learn my friend.
Here we go! Have Pam come down.
You and Pam have both been nominated for Dundie Awards!
Yeah that's fine.

Yes you did. That's right! Congratulations Meredith. We should head out.
Here we go, alright got it? Set?
You are getting so funny!  Very good.
You have big plans for tonight?
So as you know, the Dundies are my legacy. So I'm going to need to train a replacement. So this year, I have decided to have a co-host.
Shh, shh! Okay, okay. Everybody's right. They're like breadsticks on steroids. Right?
A la, tonight we will be hosting at Louie Volpies!
Black tie optional.
You are doing it.
Okay, well we'll work on it.
Think of it as part of your training.
This is my last Dundies ever, if I want mind control over him, is that too much to ask?
Jim, please no loopholes.
No, no, no! This is the performance of your life!
There you go! Lovely! Regis and Kelly! Nice! Use that as an inspiration.  Just be funny.
Mmmmkay. There needs to be what you call a rat-a-tat. And right now it's all rat and no tat. Ryan come on up here. Tap DeAngelo out. Just watch this. Okay.  Ryan how are you today?
Okay, okay. You know what, I didn't actually lose my keys...
Here we go! So, DeAngelo! You and I have a lot in common. You lost two hundred pounds, and I lose my car keys every morning.
Say it with an accent!
and make it sound perfect.
Now, tell me something terrible that happened in your childhood.
Good. Good. Good!
I'm here.  In a good way! I've been here the whole time.
Alright, here we go.
Now hit me.  One, two, three.
You can do it, just say it.
You're doing this for all those kids out there, eating off the Louie Volpies kid's menu, w
Listen to me, you're not doing this for me, you're not doing this for you, you're not even doing this for them!
No, Ryan would never do it. It's too on the radar. Look, look. The boss, hosts, the Dundies! It's sort of our perk!
Which moves us to, Best Mom Dundie.  I guess we all kinda consider her a mom around the office. Meredith Palmer!
There are a lot of great salesmen in this office, but one of our great salesmen is also a great dad. And a close personal friend of mine, Jim Halpert! Best Dad Dundie!
We're done. We're done!
Okay, we're done! That's it.
DeAngelo is expressing himself. [manager pulls the microphone cable, everyone can still here DeAngelo.
It is difficult to recognize the person who will be replacing you. But he is a good guy, so the Michael Scott Award for Best Dundies Host goes to DeAngelo Vickers.
There you go.
You know, herpes affects one in five sexually active adults?
You were laughing right?
That got a big laugh.
So what you're saying is you kinda like it?  That Phyllis bit, that was pretty good.
No, no. You're being too hard on yourself. We had a very truncated rehearsal time.
He is in an all-out sprint.
Okay! That, that is unfair! The clothing was safe, but tasteful.
What is your problem?!
Man! Maybe you should have won the Kind of a Bitch Award.
You know, despite a couple hiccups, I think that went very well.  D
That's true, we wouldn't get seats together.
We're really close.
Oh my God, something's happening.
Here he comes! Alright! You deserve it!
No it's not.
Okay, so no salami in the pants. How about a pepperoni?
How do you mean?
...in order to feed the bears.
Well, I was just thinking that maybe I should keep a salami in my pocket...
I don't own Dunder Mifflin, okay?  Look, I need your advice on something. I am told that there are bears in the Rockies.
Sick freak! What is wrong with you?
Oh, these do not taste like oysters.
Ahh, thank you. Like a butler.
That sounds good. Thank you.
Oh you don't, that's-
Yes. Yes, you know what? Take my favorite truck. Sure.
Well I have interviews.
There they are! Party Planning Committee together again!
Sounds good. Fudge it up!
What kind of toppings would you like?
What do you like Pam?
Tomorrow I want everyone to have a good time. No drama. And as for today, just a typical day. Alright?
You know what, I'm thinking maybe we should get ice cream that everybody'll like. How about vanilla? Let's get vanilla.
When Phyllis was in high school, she was so... cute.  And she still is.
Just do your best! I have faith in you.
You're not gonna lose them.
You sold us all on Andy, a product that nobody wanted.
But you're the best salesman, on the inside.
Well, okay... And Andy, Andy who needs confidence  that he is a great salesman. I give you, my clients, our ten most important accounts.

Don't be a caricature Kevin, never be a caricature. How did that feel when I tore that up?
You know who that is?
I guess this could be the one, huh?
Who's that? Who's that guy?
How would you have wanted to do it? Okay, okay. You know what? Inappropriate. I am engaged happily, and you have landed yourself a Senator.

Kelly! Kelly? Kelly.
You're not prone to seizures?
No problem. Worth a try.
Mmmhmmm. It's true. Darryl, I have one last wish. I would like to use the bailer.

So I wanted to give you that.
Dwight, I will be leaving tomorrow.

Phyllis. Phyllis, are my mittens done?
But it is already three o'clock!
Jim where is Pam?
You should see the other guy.
No, you are not going to quit today. For goodness sake, this is not going to be your last day in the office. Everybody gets dumped Gabe. Can I give you a piece of advice?
I am looking forward to lunch. And hearing about what a great boss I am.
I know, it's okay. Just, give her a hug. Alright?
Oh shoot! That's my cab.
You started with this company, as a fine young man...
Why am I so sad? Am I doing the wrong thing?
Sure.  Be right out!
I ruv you all! I ruv you very much!  J
Well power through the arthritis Phyllis you can do it!
Okay, here we are in the conference room. Once again. And I just wanted to call you all here, together, because I have something important. Well there's two things actually. Okay first, I would like a whereabouts on Pam.  And secondly, Phyllis how are those mittens coming? Because I would actually like to bring them home and pack them. I'm leaving for the day at four.
What is this meeting about?
Thats what she said.
