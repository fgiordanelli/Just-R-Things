Actually, you called me in here, but yeah.
Oh, I told you. I couldn't close it. So...
All right. Take care.
Whassup! I still love that after seven years.
Yeah, stop. That is ridiculous.
This is why the whole downsizing thing just doesn't bother me.
It's not on your desk.
What are you doing?
OK. Dwight, I'm sorry, because I have always been your biggest flan.
How do you know it was me?
What's going on?
That's why we're all going out. So we can have an end-of-the-week-drink.
No, definitely. All right, dude. Awesome. Will do.
Yeah, yeah. J
You know what? You should come with us. Because you know we're all going out and it could be a good chance for you to see what people are like outside the office. I think it could be fun.
Yeah, definitely. You too. Enjoy it.  You know what, just come here.
Great. Let me just...
Yes, I... Do you want to...
Am I walking out?
Oh no, I just decided not to. How's your headache?
How are things?
That is not the expression.
Mr. Decker, I'm sorry about that. What were you... Can you hold on one second? Yeah, just one second. Thanks.  Hello? Thanks, Dwight.
Do you really have to do that right now?
Who doesn't love that?
So then, why didn't you do it?
Six on seven.
You know what? I'm actually going to have to call you back. Thank you. Sorry about that.
Yeah, uh, Mr. Decker, please.
Oh, yeah. She's hot.
Yeah, you know, she's engaged, but...
No way. I think she likes this stuff.
We can go.
I think she wasn't wearing a card.
Um, why did she slap Martin Luther King?
Wow. But then who would watch my TV? That is...
Interesting, what's that like?
Yeah. I just don't think this is the kind of task, that I... am going to do. You know who would be great for this?
That is a great offer. Thank you. I really think I should be concentrating on sales.
OK, well, if you've never been sick, then you don't have any antibodies.
Well, why did you do that? You work here, don't you want good insurance?
You cut more than you had to, didn't you?
I thought it was a workspace?
You are not my superior.
If it's the same thing, then why did you write "workspace"?
It says "workspace".
OK, you know what Dwight? We can't write our diseases down for you because that's confidential.
I thought you said you were inventing diseases? That's spontaneous dental hydroplosion.
No I didn't.
OK, whoa. 'Cause that is a pretty intense accusation. How do you know that they're fake?
Oh, interesting, what kind of shoes?
I have nothing to do.
No, not at all.
I'm doing OK. Getting excited for the weekend though. What are you up to?
Hey Pam! How are you?
OK, can you hold on? I'm getting the, ah, beep.  Jim Halpert.
No, you can't fire me.
Who is this?
Absolutely, I do.
Um, I know that it involves spying on people and we may build a fort, underground.
I think it has something to do with Survivor, but I'm not sure.
But listen, I'm going to have to talk to her a lot. All right? And there may be chatting, and giggling. And you gotta just pretend to ignore it. Wipe it away.
Well I'm trying to. Do you see what I'm doing?
What? Oh no no no. Dwight, no. I'm using her, for the alliance. Who knows the most information about this office? Pam.
I'm on it.
Yeah, what do you think that's about?
Well, tensions were high in the kitchen.
Oh, Italian. Nice. Wow! You got the works there. Red onion, provolone...
Well, I don't know, if Kevin's in accounting, and Toby's in Human Resources and they're talking...
Their bread is very good.
I love their sandwiches too.
Because we're strong, Dwight. Because we're strong.
OK, listen, we need to assume that everyone in the office is forming an alliance and is therefore trying to get us kicked off.
No, will not, I'm not going to tell anybody. This is between you and me.
Sure, what's up?
I know, but it's gonna be a little tough because there's no good place to hide there.
Thank you, thank you. OK.
I can't do that. You won't be able to breathe.
Right... That's good.
Pam, he's in a box. He's downstairs, in a box, on the floor, near the shelves. I'm serious. Go down there and work your magic.
Yeah, well, three dollars a mile. It's gonna end up being like 50 bucks. So... God, I can't even calculate what you're gonna have to give.
Speaking of which, I meant to tell you. Very impressive, the uh, donation you gave to Oscar's charity. What was it? 25 bucks?
It's stupid. It's, it's just office pranks.
God, I don't even, I don't even know how to explain this. Uh, um... Dwight, uh, asked me to be in an alliance. And then um... um... we were... we've just been messing with him. Uh, because of the whole alliance thing. Um...
No, dude, no, I was just, listen! Whoa.
No, no, dude, no.
If we can get him to drive to Connecticut... and put peroxide in his hair...
But before he does so, I told him that he should dye his hair to go undercover.
OK. I have just convinced Dwight that he needs to go to Stamford and... ... spy on our other branch. No no no.
God, this is so sad. This is the smallest amount of power I've ever seen go to someone's head. Phyllis, can you believe this?
Oh my God.
Uh, I heard it.
I'll do it. Wear a little flouncey skirt if you want, and...
I think I'll see you at the mall. Yeah.
Is that trash talk from Pam?
You gonna wish me luck?
Have a good game man.
Really? I thought I'd take Roy.
You know what? Let me take Roy.
Take it easy.
I didn't sign anything.
Okay, I do. There like mini briefcases, alright?  Lots of guys have them. D
You buy a purse. D
He did pick a good one. P
I'm going to be the prettiest girl in the ball.  Oh, how much? P
Yes, well I want to stress test it. You know, in case anything happens. P
Hi my name's Dwight Schrute and I would like to buy a purse from you. Good lord, look at these purses! This is something special. Oh my God is this Salvatore Di-chini-asta? P
He's a grown man P
Katy but you know what, don't try to sell me one. Okay, seriously 'cause I'm just here to learn. K
That is cool. Well, I'll see you Monday though, right? P
What are you doing? P
And stuff... yeah. P
This is a really nice car. In case you haven't noticed, this is a Corolla. Okay. K
Alright now, I'm gonna warn you. Don't freak out, okay?  K
I got it.
I got this.
Oh, I can't because I keep them hidden. I don't want to look at them and get cocky. M
Well I think if you use the same jokes it just comes across as lazy.
No, it's hilarious, you're right. I just think, um, "world's longest engagement", um, we're all expecting it, you know?
Yeah, gotta eat somewhere.
Yes, I have not gotten one either. So, keep going.
Oh my God! You are so drunk!
I don't know, what?
Dwight come on, come-
He's a volunteer.
Whoa, careful, careful.
No you don't.
Goodnight, have a good night. Thank you Angela.
Not really a question.
Um... 'Fifty signs your priest might be Michael Jackson.'
Oh! There it is!
Um... I don't think so.
Except pass that breathalyzer.
Yeah. As a child, did Pam show any traits that would hint towards her future career as a receptionist?
Good. Cause I have a lot of questions.
No, thanks. I'm good.
Wow! That is really hard. You really think you can go all day long? Well, you always left me satisfied and smiling, so... M
Does that include 'That's What She Said'?
Yes!  So close.  I really love the paper triangle flicking and hitting things game.  Yeah.
Phyllis by a nose. Gold medal in Flernenton.
Dig deep, dig deep! OHHHhhh! It's Phyllis!
Wow! Ok. No one else should even try! Gold medals! Give him medals. Wow.
Oh my god. Phyllis, coming alive. I like it.
Ryan Howard. Ryan!  Gold medal.
Who had someone from Vance Refrigeration?
Nothing. Guys? Timer's still going? Er?
Time to beat is one minute, 15 seconds. Here they come.  Guys?
Notify the athletes. P
Okay, today. 5 o'clock. Closing Ceremonies.
Mmm. Hey, can you ignore those and do something for me instead?
Hey, would you mind coming out here for a second? I just have something for you.
Nothing. I just wanted to congratulate you on your condo. M
Those are the doves.
Um... 'Cause your condo's in America.
These are the Closing Ceremonies. Step up. You're on the top one.
Wow. Bridges of Madison County, Legally Blond, these movies are just... .
Five movies. Go ahead. P
Yeah, so we'll get right... You know what? I'll be right back. Stanley, you're taking over for me, buddy. I'll be right back. S
Oh! Right! Right, right, right, come-ah on, on, on.  Desert Island. Five movies. Go. K
I'm a three hole punch version of Jim. 'Cause you can have me either way. Plain White Jim, or Three-hole Punch.
Okay, okay. Um, how 'bout, the ultimate team player?
Okay, okay... P
Um. He sticks to his guns.
Yeah.  Yeah. You know what? Maybe... maybe I will.
Um... it's in Maryland.
Toby? Mm hmm.  I really have to take this Creed, so it was really worth... M
Oh, hold that thought. Hold that thought.
Is this you? Are you being you, or is this Creed? Are you...
That's an overreaction.
Alright.  I'm really sorry, but I have to let you go. And it's purely budgetary. It's not personal... M
We should switch seats in order to... M
Oh, are you firing Creed?
Oh, you want me to be you?
It wasn't me.
Ok, thank you, gotta get back to work.
Uh, yeah, ream.
Hi, Dwight, um, what sort of discounts are we giving on the 20 lb white model.
Colder... warmer... little warmer... there you go, ooh, warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer... warmer ... cold, cold, cold, back up... ooh, ooh, warmer, hot, red hot,  hot, very hot.
I think you should retrace your steps.
Okay, calm down.  Where was the last place you saw it?
That is weird.
Assistant to the Sensei, that's pretty cool.
Oh, I thought it was your mom.
Was that your mom?
117 Mount Bergin St. R
Well, at least I don't have cavities.
You making this up as you go along, aren't you?
Good, and it absolutely is a toy. Arigatou. D
Ok, say please. D
Oh, that's not advice. What advice sounds like is t
No I'm not.
You know a ton of fourteen year old girls?
Just have Dwight punch you. M
I can't. I just got a manicure.
Ooh, what about, uh,  Dwight's dojo?
What, what are you going to do? Bring it, Beesley. Bring it. Oh yeah, good move. Not such an ultimate fighter now. P
No.  They're in the conference room.
We are doing worst first dates.
Oh, those are drawings.  In case the writing didn't really put a picture in your head.  And there he is, in the flesh, Agent Michael Scarn.  Now we know what he looks like.
How long is this?   Oh, Pam. Good work! Oop, wait, stop.  Drawings.
Agent Michael Scarn.
The lead role of Agent Michael Scarn?
Do you want to play- D
Why not, Dwight?  This is a movie.  I mean, this is for all of America to enjoy.
Alright, let's get this started.  I'm gonna be reading the action descriptions, and Phyllis, I would like you to play Catherine Zeta Jones.
Michael Scarn takes out a nine-millimeter gun and shoots the-
That's actually a good idea.  We'll all take a brief intermission.   Hey, are you hungry?
Nice.  That's excellent, because bugs love my famous grilled cheese sandwich.
Travel.  I've been looking forward to it.  It's gonna be... really nice.  Gonna find myself.
Could it be that Agent Michael Scarn has finally found his Catherine Zeta?
Oh, come on, Pam.  I-
Least I didn't leave you at a high school hockey game.
You're right, we didn't dance.  It was more like, swaying.  But still romantic.
Dinner and a show, if you include Michael's movie.   And there was dancing and fireworks.  Pretty good date.
Cause there was dinner, by candlelight.
Wow.  Um, ok.
Ok, you know what, uh, how much is that?
You're not having sex.
No.  Thank you.
Wait, wait; one thing.  Uh, by tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right?
Alright... well, I'm not asking for a raise. I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.
No, we don't.
We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.
Eck!... Oh! Also, it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.  So, keep that goin'.
...Saturday, so just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch. Ok, talk to you soon.
No, that was unbelievable.
Course, it's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it?
Hey, how's it goin'?
Yeah, no, I don't think you can.
Um, you don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.  Especially working together.
I don't really wanna picture it.  But thank you, Pam.
Are we in danger?
So, don't tell.
Because it's a surprise.
Because not everybody knows about the party.
Could, keep that down.
Oh, uh, no. Could-
I think Stanley just coughed.
Improv sounds great.
Aw, that sounds like a lot of fun.
Because you said "do you wanna hang out"-
Uh hmm, definitely.
Oh, um... .I can't.
Yup, it's, uh, four o'clock.
Oh, ok, cool.  M
Oh man.  Oh, you know what, speaking of which, I was just trying to get a handle on, you know, numbers for food and stuff.  So do you think that Roy's gonna come, or...
Uh, actually, I haven't talked to her in a while.
Well, the group tour is now leaving, then.  Ladies and gentlemen, just a few things that we are gonna be pointing out to you today, you will be able to see both bedrooms and, uh, if we're lucky, maybe get a chance to peek into the bathroom, who knows.  I have to remind you that flash photography is prohibited and as much as you can, please refrain from touching things. I know you might want to.
Hey!  Just in time!  You wanna go on the group tour? We were just about to leave.
Great.   Just wanna let you guys know that we will be taking the tour like I promised-
Oh, uh, later-ish.
That's because Mark's my roommate.
Yeah, you don't have to, ummm.  Alright, yes, that's not gonna be awkward at all.
You know what?  Let's just leave that image out of it, because this is a happy place.  Happy thoughts, Pam.  Happy thoughts.
Yeah, that... Yep, that feels about right.
Ok, sure. Will do.
My home office, this is it.
This is my desk.
See, I knew we lost somebody on the tour.  It's-
There is soda inside.
Chicken, hot dog, burger.
That's great. Well don't tell me who it is, cause I can .. M
Well, there's a $20 limit, right? So .. ?
Well, I can't tell you cause it's a secret. M
I think I did a pretty good job.
Great. Where did you get it?
There's a little more to it.
I thought that was called Nasty Christmas.
What is Yankee Swap?
Oh, shouldn't we ... I bought that specifically for Pam.
Got to be kidding me.
Sure you don't want the teapot?
Yeah, but, Michael, the point is that we all bought gifts for specific people.
You don't even drink tea.
Look, it has sentimental value, Dwight. Can I buy it from you?
Come on, it's a shamrock keychain. Good luck.
But .. P
I didn't think you were going to get that one. I really didn't.
Oh, there it is. J1.
Wow, that's weird. Oh, dollar for a stapler, that's pretty good.
What's up, buddy?
So that he can have us rob a bank, and then escape through the sewers.
"It's time for our first quarter camaraderie event, so pack a swimsuit, a toothbrush, rubber-soled shoes, and a ski mask."
I'm not really sure what movie you're talking about. Are you sure you got the title right?
Yeesh, how old is this ship?
It's not hilarious, but... R
Yeah.  Darryl! Darryl! Darryl!
Um... let's see, uh...  The customer. Because the customer is king.
I don't know. Let's break up.
Yeah. She's really funny, and she's warm. And she's just... well, anyway.
That's... great. You know, to tell the truth, I used to have a big thing for Pam, so... M
She was always engaged.
What a night.
Oh, right, because you announced that his ship was sinking?
What happened to you?
Thanks, Katy. Um, didn't really prepare anything to say. We're all caught pretty unprepared with this whirlwind courtship. I guess I just wanna say that Pam is the greatest. My best friend. And she's awesome. And...
No, I really don't want to.
Yeah, that's right.
You burned your foot on a Foreman Grill?
It's, okay, it's Jim.  Just say again, uh, really loudly what happened.
What is going on?
I'm sorry? Pam. P
He's still driving... Dwight, you forgot your bumper!
Oh Dwight, Dwight,   Ohhhhhh!Jim and P
He hit the pole! J
What was that... P
But you said that you went out with her this weekend.
So, where are you shipping your foot?
And that isn't weird?
You mean today?  He stepped on a George Foremen grill and he burned his foot.Billy M
Just keep him awake.
I'm just gonna get... D
Wake up.  D
You can't lay down.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Slowly, slowly.  Let's just get to the elevator.
You don't think you should sit in the back with Dwight?
We're going to the hospital, Michael.
We're going to Chuck E. Cheese.
Come on, get inside.
Well, I think she has a kid.
Will you stop?
Give the bottle to Michael!
Give the bottle to Michael
Oh my God, Dwight, put that down.
Come on Dwight.
So you thought they meant your reason for coming to the hospital.
Concussion.  What did you write?
It's Kurt.  Wow, I am so sad that I know that.
But they shouldn't be much longer now, so we'll be back soon.
Michael went in there with him too.  It's pretty sweet.
Uh hmm, he should be fine, but, uh, they brought him in for a CAT scan.
Dunder Mifflin, this is Jim. P
Nothin' much what's up with you?
Umm, is it me or does it smell like up-dog in here?
Remember that thing I told you on the booze cruise about Pam? That... was... personal so if we can just keep that between you and me. That would be great.
Alright. Great. Thank you.
I'm going to take off actually.
I don't know what you mean.
I'm going with grape.
Oh, ah, no but no. You know what let's go out. That was a good idea.  Let's go out.
No, that's alright, thank you though. It's, I, gotta do some cleaning, should probably stick around here.
I don't know probably just gonna eat my ham and cheese sandwich in the break room.
Um, I had asked Michael if I could head up the Oscar investigation and he said that only Dwight was capable of handling such sensitive material.
Tony the tiger.  You don't hear that much any more.
Can I just have the ham and cheese sandwich, thanks.
Nope we're not brothers.
Thanks, thanks Dana.
Wow, that's not what I meant.
What about you?
Uh, I really don't want to talk about it.
Just you know politics, literature.
And Pam it was like three years ago so I am totally over it.
Oh yeah, yeah... hope that's okay.
No, no, you saw through me, great.
Oh you did?
And seriously, it's totally not a big deal, ok? And when I found out you were engaged, I mean.
Well I thought that, I figured you should hear it from me rather than, I mean you know Michael.
Hey oh, listen, um, I told Michael on the booze cruise. It's so stupid. Um, I told Michael that I had had a crush on you when you first started here.
It expired in August, and my cell phone charger from two years ago.
Ah, coupon for a free sandwich.
Look its one day, everything's gonna be alright. No big deal. You good?
Hey, hey, wow, wow. Listen man it's, you know what. It's not a big deal.
Umm, what happened?
Good!  What's goin' on here?
So, how was the resort?  Did you ski a lot?
But there's definitely a desk open in the back. M
That might be a little difficult with the one computer. M
Allergy to... the desk? K
It's the lever on the side.
I have no idea.
Are you interested in her?
What do you think of Kelly?
Nothing much.  Let me ask you something.  It's actually little awkward.
So, that's how it's gonna be.
So, you just couldn't take it anymore, huh?
To one without a cubicle.
And then you just changed desks, right?
So, you used to share that cubicle with Kelly, right?
Thanks for the head's up, Kev.
Yep. Cool, man.
Yeah. I like talking to her too.
Yeah. Nope. Yeah. Definitely.
Oh, no, no. No.
I think you should do it. That's great!
Nice. Well, what's it all about?
Did you really?
It's a complete... well, actually it's exactly what you'd expect, so... How are the girls?
You got to take a chance on something sometime, Pam. I mean, do you want to be a receptionist here, always?
Roy said that.
Do you mean vibrate?
Oh, that one was good.
It was there when I sat down. D
OH, that's great. I'm really happy for
Oh, no, not while I'm here.
Take it slow. 'Cause it seems like a lot of the time things like that need...
Well, he's not, though. So you just gotta suck it up. You just gotta move on. Try to have some fun. Come to my poker game tonight.
Yeah. Alright, Beesly, Hey, Happy Valentine's Day. P
Can we not?
Oh, I should get back. Talk to you guys later.
Where do I want to go?
Really for like how long?
When did you go there?
I was thinking more like Europe. Or something like that. But, good second choice.
What is that?
So. Uh... I am going on a trip. But not really sure where I'm going yet. It's kind of open-ended. So I was hoping maybe you guys would have some suggestions?
Can I go?
Which means absolutely nothing.
No. We're not.
You've got to wave your arms and you've got to pound your fists. Many times. It's supposed to emphasize your point.
The great speakers throughout history were not joke tellers. They were people of passion. So if you want to do well today, you got to do what they did.
Mmmhmm. And the first thing they teach you is that you've got to be true to your self. And you are all about authority.
You know I majored in Public Speaking in College.
Okay. Just trying to get some advice on my trip.
Yeah. I'm definitely going.
Yeah. Do you want me to take these on my way out?
Yeah. And I'm really sorry about that, I just... P
I'm... leaving on June 8th.
I don't know. I feel like I have plenty of time to figure out the details but... P
I'm going. I'm a little nervous to run into Dwight on his connecting flight to Mordor. But, other than that... um, yeah, I bought the ticket, non-refundable.
The ocean. M
Let's start with... your mom.
I'm Jim.  Annnnd... let's sell some paper.
Yesss. And you're Abby, right? A
Definitely. Yes. Glad you said that. ...You don't want to help me with some of my sales, do you? 'Cause, I'm kind of swamped.
Aww, best book?
Can't believe his mom dressed him like that, that's the real tragedy.
Ohh, man, I would love to! I can't tonight, but can I come over some other time?
No, um. How is this not a pyramid scheme? M
Hey. ...Oh, happy birthday.
Kelly, you know what...
Maybe, but... we're gonna need somebody to create a diversion, and...
Yeah, you don't?
Just... quit stalling.
Yeah. Okay. Oh. I dare you to make an announcement.
You... owe me.
Well that's an invasion of privacy, so, I'm going to tell Michael.
Is that Michael?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.
...It's something to think about.
Volunteer duty. D
I do not think that is funny. P
Well, I'm not actually making a formal complaint. I just really think we should talk about it.
And I didn't tell anyone because I'm not really sure how I feel about it.
Dwight tried to kiss me.
You mean your thoughts and feelings?
Well, what does Roy think about everything?
Well, it was redacted. Look, if she wants an invite, maybe she's just trying to be friends.
Well, it saves time, you know. 'Cause we could just meet in the parking lot every morning. Walk in together. Perfect.
What did I write?
Yeah. Maybe we should both go.
And I took it right back. It was like... P
You know, it was one day.
I... I didn't know that Toby was gonna write it down.  I was just venting.
I'm the one who complained about you.
Pam, it wasn't her.
Okay, I'll try.
It was just little thing, you know, like I could make something shake or I could make a marble fall off the counter. You know, just little things.
Ever since I was a little kid, like, eight or nine, I could sort of control things with my mind.
I can always kind of win at roulette.
That doesn't exist anymore. M
Guys, the Afghanistananies.
Wait, wait, where you going? I mean, even if you don't hire a band, you still have to watch the bands. Pam, these are people who have never given up on their dreams. I have great respect for that. And, yes, they're all probably very bad and that will make me feel better about not having dreams. P
Oh, my God, that's Kevin! Great song, Kev. Oh,  my God, he's the drummer and the singer.
Let's take a look. Nice.
Your mom would love that. She would. Oh, this band is called Scrantonicity.
No, Pam, you're gonna lose him to another wedding.
Yeah, you haven't seen that since 1983. That is amazing. Okay, we have to sign him. I'm gonna call the label, we're gonna...
Thank you very much. It was fun.
Oh. Three nines.
Wow. I think you're bluffing.
What was this?
So, that's still going on, huh? You and Kelly?
Yeah, why did you?
Yeah, we all really...
No, thanks. You having fun?
Not your fault. I'm sorry I misinterpreted our friendship.
Come on. I don't wanna do that. I wanna be more than that.
Don't do that.
I just needed you to know. Once.
I'm really sorry if that's weird for you to hear, but I needed you to hear it. Probably not good timing, I know that. I just...
I was just... I'm in love with you.
Yeah. Hey, can I talk to you about something?
Hey, how's it going?
Okay, will do.
Are you really gonna marry him?   ...Ok.
No I'm not drunk.  Are you drunk?
Uh-huh, yeah.  I am.
Oh, I can do that.
Oh! Lots of results.
Let's find out.
No, it's not. I did. Yep.
Yeah, sold about forty thousand.
Oh, Dwight. I've missed you so much.
Oh, no, sorry, it's an inside joke. There's this bartender at Stamford who, uh... you know what? You'd just have to be there.
And a dart board.
That is a lot of liquor.
All right, nice meeting you, Ted. Take care.
Michael, it's really not a competition.
Oh, no, it was... you know, a good opportunity for me, a promotion. I got a chance to... M
Hey, how is... Toby?
Oh, tell him I say hi.
Oh my God. Dwight got a hooker! Oh my God, I gotta call... well, I gotta call somebody, I don't even know who to call. Dwight got a hooker!
No, we used to. Now we're friends.
How are you?
Yeah. Okay, maybe.
That's all right.
Nope, that's okay.
No, I just... I heard something about that. It's just, I kind of put it all on the line. Twice, actually. And she said no. Twice.
Michael, it's not about... I transferred because of Pam.
Can I get a drink?
Can I get a drink?
I'm just killing Germans, any way I can.
Oh, I'm sorry I don't know... what we're talking about...
I'm sorry what are you whispering about?
Oh yeah, definitely.
Mmm, that's where you're wrong.  I'm your project supervisor today, and I have just decided that we're not doing anything until you get the chips that you require.  So, I think we should go get some.  Now, please.
And then we checked the fax machine.
I have no idea.  We went right for the copier.
Oh, there's no game.  We're just trying to get these chips for Karen.
Wow.  Never pegged you for a quitter.
Where'd I find what?
That's okay.  Oh, no, it's not. I'm sorry, is that your husband in the tub with him?
He's so cute.
So I guess I can't get up.
No, I didn't. I took back my chair that you took from me, but I didn't take your chair. K
Love me, say that you love me. Fool me, fool me, go on and fool me.
fool me, fool me, go on and fool me. Love me,
Love me, love me, say that you love me, fool me, fool me,
Forget it. I was just about to brag but forget it.
How many words per minute does the average person type?
How far away did you think we were?
What time is it here? Um, we're in the same time zone. P
Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead. P
And I was just going to go through the system cause I didn't think you'd be there. Why, why are you still there?
Sorry, I forgot Kevin's extension. It's a fantasy football thing. P
Ah, hey. P
Yeah. Bye Pam.
Oh, no no. P
Yes!  How are you going to cook every meal of the day in one kitchen? P
Most apartments these days have like three.
Wow, you got totally taken for a ride Beesley.
Yes. Fancy New Beesley would make that up. New apartment, new stories.
No way. How do you confuse 28 Days with 28 Days Later?
I saw the movie. I just don't know every line from the film.
See, that's weird.
Oh, Holy Mother of God.
Can I have a ride, man? I... uh... I have my bike.
No kidding. And I am just going to lie down in the back, if that's all right.
Man, you can really hold your liquor, Billabelli.
I'm a drunk driver.
Nope, I got eel.
Oh, umm... kinda hard to explain.
Well, I work here now.
Really? Wow... that's bad.
What does that mean?
Okay, so is it like sales or... accountants?
I know it's not definite or whatever, but uh, do you know who's coming over here from Scranton?
Say what you will about Michael Scott, but he would never do that.
No. No, no. Just um... some personal stuff. And I'm not really ready to revist that, I don't think.
No, it's just I'm not sure if I um... well to be quite honest with you, Jan, I have a few unpleasant memories of Scranton. And um...
New York City is 45 minutes down the road from here. And you wanna  move to Scranton? I dunno. If I were you I'd move to New York?
You'd actually move to Scranton?
I really don't know.  How you doing with all this?
Yes. This is going to be very interesting. All right, I'm out of here. See you later? K
Awesome! Good to be back. The place looks really good.
Yeah, I was just doing a little joke there about how we'd never met... P
This one taken? No. Good.
Let me get that for you.
You know, man, it's really you're call.
Hey! How are you man? Good to see... you.
No. Looks good.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Okay. Sounds good. D
All right. Good to be back.
Oh. Is that like your new thing?
How are you, man?
Great. What's new with you?
Oh, this looks promising.
You feel good?
Not bad, but you are Italian so... try it more Italian.
Terrible. Totally unconvincing.
Oh! Um... tonight, actually? No. I'm uh just still getting settled.
Well, I'm evolving, Pam.
Does he ever.
Yeah, it does, actually. D
Yeah. Good to be back.
I just think I should tell you that... I've sort of started seeing someone. And uh... P
I thought you had already... left. P
Bye, Angela. All right, Kev.
Yeah, I never even knew that part of the office existed.
Just about... yup. Now.
...Absolutely you should.
Yeah, trust me, that would be fun for no one.
She is dating Ryan, I think.
...Okay I can't... help you... with that.
Lead off with that. She loves hunting. She also loves those ads for Six Flags, with the old guy.  Got it. Also... do you speak pig latin?
Uh, you know what though? I feel like I already sicked him on Pam... we'll give her a break. Let's think of someone else.
...Oh, you know what? ... It was... gonna be Pam, but... K
...I'm messing with Andy. I'm sending him to all the women in the office with... just... terrible information on how to get them to go out with him.
Yup. That's perfect.
Hold on, let me think about that, yes, that'll work. But can you sing in a sexy high falsetto voice?
Quick question - do you play the guitar?
Okay, Michael. Come on. Let us out. M
Well, you're... in... prison, but, mmhmm. P
That is... quite the rap sheet, Prison Mike.
Where... did you learn all of this?
Wow. What have we got here?
Merry Christmas Dwight.
But the paint's chipping. Is that your old bike, Michael?
Wow. What kind of bike is that?
It just feels a little bit, like... P
No, because of the promotion. P
Last year, my boss, Michael Scott, took a day off because he said he had pneumonia, but really, he was leaving early to go to magic camp. Wow.
Are you serious? P
Could you please keep it down?
OK.  Wow, thanks for taking all the excuses, dude.
And she's trying to correctly butcher a goose, but she's having trouble coming up with it.
I'm sure they'll want to meet her, too.
What a horrible, horrible movie that was. K
Yeah. Which, don't get me wrong, can be a really fun distraction, but, when it's over, you're left thinking about the girl you really like, the one that broke your heart.
You just had a rebound.
Well, for starters, I've known you as a couple since the beginning of the relationship, which was approximately  three hours ago. M
Oh no, that would be great. P
Oh, you know what? Sorry, forgot to tell you. I intercepted a transmission earlier and it seems that the CIA is gonna need Dwight down at their headquarters in Langley for training and an ice cream social with the other agents. P
So, really, you're just calling her?
Oh my God, Karen, you're right, that is Animal from the Muppet Babies.
Dwight Schrute is now wearing a baby's bonnet.
No, let the record show that Dwight K. Schrute is now completely nude and is holding a plastic knife to Stanley's neck?!
Dwight, you know what, just back up, okay, that's making me uncomfortable. This is sexual harassment, by the way. Oh my God! He's got a knife!
OK. Uh, Karen, any news from that law firm? K
Yep, it's English, it's "impossible."
Yeah. Yes. Um, I'm just in this, like, stupid fight with Karen. P
Hmm, what? P
Oh, yeah, How have we not talked about this already? I mean what happened there? Kidnapping?
Is that not what happens when you're high?
In the picture, are you high?
Are you stoned?
Oh, loves it.
Oh well, 'Yoy' should bring in 'Long Tim' in one day. Shouldn't he?
Pam, meet Harvey. This is Michael's new friend.
Yeah, you can.
Yup. I'll trade.
You still do that thing?
Hey, Kelly, it's Jim. K
Sure. Look at you!
Yeah. Can I see it when I get back?
Which one was it?
No way! All right Pam. Congratulations.
Pam? Did I ever have a 'thing' for her? No, why? Did she say something? K
You gonna answer it?
Fine. Party pooper.
Encourage him? I'm the victim, okay? He's fishing for me. We've got to do something.
So Andy is in rare form today. K
I liked you better when you were the temp.
You wanna pull a prank on Andy?
Are there any messages?
Okay, good. Stay right here. A
Would you like to pull a prank on Andy?
You know what?  Maybe it's in the ceiling.
What are you talking about?
"It's not freakin' funny!"
Good advice Beesley.  Thanks.  See you out there.
No, I'm sure you're right.
Yeah, I know I should.
Oh.  Yeah well, I guess there's been a couple late nights. Karen and I have been up talking.
Oh yeah.  Why?
Stop.  That's disgusting.
Yep, Spongebob Squarepants.
Ah, gotcha.  Okay, so they have Albert Einstein, Ben Franklin, or Sponge Bob Squarepants.
Are you okay?
Michael, Dwight would like your man meat.
Really?  Looks like I hired the right guy.  I'm glad.  Any real potential there Beesley?
What are you doing?
Phyllis and Robert.
Did you ever see that movie?
You know what? I bet a lot of them are wedding crashers.
I know. It's very cute.
Come on. Get out there. Give the people what they want.
When are we going to get to see some of those famous Beesly dance moves?
The bat, I mean, I know I felt it bite me, but look. There's no mark. I feel so... tingly... so strangely powerful...  Oh well.
That bread on your desk? I just picked it up. It's white hot. K
Oh, thank God. I have such a headache from that glare.
Cool. Okay. I'm gonna go home and lie down, draw the shades... there's just so much sun in here... bye Dwight. D
No, I got it.
I am ready.
Oh, that could be interesting.
What are you reading?
Those are the books that sum up the other books.
Sorry, quick thing. Is it true that if you can't get out, you don't want anyone to help you? M
Oh. Um. I think we're good.
Oh no thanks, I think Karen and I will take my car.
Oh, ok. Cool. Thanks for telling me. K
No, it was before I knew you so, its fine.
Here we go...
Kev, have a good weekend.
I don't know.  Feel like... Friday night crowds...
You don't know what it is.
Okay.  Um... Got you something.
Where'd you get that?
I didn't say anything.  I was waiting to see what happened.
Sex, Steve Martin, Terri Hatcher.
Can I have a raise?
I can't hear you.
Hey, Mike.  Since Roy left I've been doing a lot more work, and I need a raise.
We'll see.  I'm sure you guys will... find you way back to one another someday.
No, I mean, you guys really seem to have a strong connection.
Well... yes, that's probably what it is.  So what do I do?
Thanks, Kev.  I'm good though.
Didn't think you'd notice...
Wow.  I guess word got around.  That's a nice... honor.
No, I'm not gonna call you that.
Hey, Andy.  How are you, man?
Andy!  Nah, that's too far.
Dwight says that he actually doesn't know one single fact about bear attacks.
Andy, Dwight says welcome back, and he could use a hug.
I don't know, we'll figure somethin' out.
No, don't worry about it.  We'll just got double or nothin'.
Ok, you're on.
You really wanna bet?
Oh, don't be that person.
I'm gonna say fifty.
There's like ten green ones.
I'd say like... 10,000 to 1?
Oh, excuse me.  It's my... favorite part.
Oh my God, there is a castle.
Oh.  He's going to kill himself, pretending to kill himself.
OK. careful, thanks.
No no no!
Come on. He'll listen to you.
OK, Ryan you know what? You can do this.
Oh, you know what we should probably preserve the batteries.
Fact.  Bears eat beets.  Bears.  Beets.  Battlestar Galactica.
False.  Black bear.
Absolutely.  I couldn't be more sorry about this.
One more.  Why are you talking like that?
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna go alone.
Yeah, I gotta call out on that.
Oh, did the press ask for a story?
I was thinkin' about more like a CD, or... a CD.
What about music?  Do you have any music?
You know her name.
Did that really need to be said?
No, I don't think so.
Which one... is she?
Oh, is she that teacher in the white?
Well... that's not gonna hold up in court.
Oh my God.
Probably another high-school student.
Not important.  Because you're not dating her.  Because it's a felony.
Andy... is having a real rough day today.
And you should.School O
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
A-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh, a-wimowheh...
Come on man, just give it a couple days.  I think you'll be all right.
Look at that.
Or a high school girl. Let's go .
She looks older.
Then you did nothing wrong. We should go.
Oh, my God! Wow.
No, can't help you now.
Hypothetically. Hypothetically you were making out in the woods.
You shouldn't be talking about that.
Oh. You don't have to tell me this.
Dr. Johnson, we need you in surgery right away.Spanish T
No, that's your conscience. Listen to it.
Don't do it.
Really? Way to earn it. Hey, Andy?
I drive a Saab station wagon.
Not that I know of.
How old do you think I am?
No, nope. What else? What else? You watch The Hills? What is Heidi thinking?
Hey, uh, does Mr. Nortman still teach here? He's a jerk, right?
You should take up a musical instrument. D
Oh, I don't smoke. Sorry.
So, high school.
Oh, you don't want to know.
OK, I want a copy on my desk by the end of the day or you will receive a full disadulation.
Which would be me.
Now that sounds serious.
Lay it on me.
Oh, I understand. And I also have lots of questions, like, what does a demerit mean?
"Jim Halpert, tardiness." Ugh. I love it already.
Oh, what's this?
The police are on it. They say they've already had three calls.
OK, I'll call the real police.
Mm... not really, no.
Question. Won't that interfere with your other task forces?
Why don't you run the meeting? You play with dolls.
Wait a second, how are you qualified for that?
I think you mean a girl's locker room. And in the fantasy, there's usually girls in it.
Not really. I've seen a bathroom before.
No. Thank you, though.
Oh, right. I remember that one. She read it to me. She said she's not really ready to date somebody in the office, but she really likes you as a friend.
No, we've been dating for six months.
Six-month anniversary. What?
In the women's bathroom, above the sink.
I saw him two minutes ago.
Don't.  I have information about the sex predator.
No, you're not. I'm looking right at you.
Hey, Dwight. It's Jim.
No. I'm not a lawyer, but I don't think this is the place to do this.
Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort! Vol-de-mort!
I know. Okay, we will be Voldemort.
Really? Not Slytherin?
Yup.  Perfect, oooh, just made it. OK, turn left.
What are you doing? M
If this job is in a well, I don't want it.
And that is not the same at all. If you're going to ask other people to do it, you should do it yourself.
Oh, okay. Hello. Hey, David. Sure.
Are you not gonna put out the torches?
No, Michael, people are blindfolded. That's a hazard.
The torches are lit.
Just one. M
He's gonna throw up.
All right. M
You know what? Why don't you take the rest of the day, figure it out and then come back and tell me what you got. K
Yeah, I'm not going to talk about this now. K
Okay, just so I understand it, in your wildest fantasy you are in Hell and you are co-running a bed and breakfast with the devil? D
She could put the cup right there.
Yeah, bigger actually.
Oh wow, that sounds like fun. Is your friend named Karen too?  What did she accomplish? K
I'm gonna introduce myself.
Oh, man.  You know what?  This might take a while.  You really don't have to stay, if you don't want.
Yeah.  Kinda feel bad for her though.
So that's a... bonus.  D
There you go.
Oh, no, absolutely.
I'm sorry, wait, so is the question "How'd I get to be so awesome?"
I should leave.
And even though... I came back, I just, I feel like I've never really... come back.
The real reason that I went to Stamford... was because... I wanted to be... not here.
All right.  Then... it's a date.
Pam.   Um, are you free for dinner tonight?
You paid for it?
How much did you pay for it?
Really, what kind of celebrity?
Oh that sounds fun. I'm mountain biking on Sunday. On Montage Mountain.
Who was driving?
I can also take 3 people.
Oh good, so we don't have to work.
I wouldn't... I wouldn't worry about it. Don't touch it.
I think she's awake.
Six of one, really.
Why won't more people do that?
It is going really great.
Wow! There it is.
I mean I can see how it would seem a bit like we uh... How it looks like um... I mean now a days you can edit anything, right? I mean you can edit anything to look like um... anything.
Great, it's gonna cost a couple a hundred buck and ah... oh actually more with tips.
You know what though, I've actually seen ads for nurses that you can hire by the hour, for parties and bachelor events.
Which we are.
Bat birth c
Yeah, I mean I personally am definitely on board for the giant check.
You couldn't have taken off all your clothes in the men's room?
I can imagine.
Oh, would you look at that.
Right. Let's do some good.
That's what I thought.
OK, but what if I told you all the money you spend here, goes to preventing a disease that's already been cured.
Oh, and I get to carry it.
Wow! You are a downer. We were having a pretty nice day.
Glass of water would be a start.
Well, you're probably dehydrated.
What are you doing here? Did you come back for us, or...
I'm sorry, are you saying that Meredith was drunk at 9 AM?
I guess.  How dare you.
I'm just gonna grab some chips, you want some?
Oh wow, thank you.
Actually, we've been dating for a couple months.
Ummm... yup. Yes, we are.
Sorry, uh do we need to sign one, or...?
Hey. So now that we are dating, uh, we just wanted to know if we had to sign one of those 'we're dating' things for the company.
Oh no, we're just sitting here.
Fair enough. Wow! We should have started dating like a long time ago.
Wait. What?  You knew? And you didn't say anything?
Swear to God. . Aww this is great. I was actually gonna wait and tell you on your birthday, but this is much more fun.
Why do you have the Big picture up again? You used that already, when you burned your foot.
Nice to meet you.
Hey, Amy.  How ya doing?
For me, it was.
That's honest.  Alright, fair enough. It was really fun while it lasted though, wasn't it?
I knew it. Oh man, just like that huh?
Alright I just have to ask now that we're public, um, is the magic gone?
What about a gift basket full of cash?
Why don't we just go by ourselves?
That whole lifestyle, his whole vibe, you find that appealing?
Yeah, he's definitely something.
Into a lake.
Yeee... (grunts in frustration)
Mmhmm, yeah, last time I was there I had a lot of fun.
I know.  I love it there.
That was slightly harsh, don't you think?
Got it.  They're like the penguins of the airplane family.
They do?  So, cars are flightless airplanes.
What about cars?
As opposed to...
Wait for it.
Oh, please, it was my pleasure.  Well we all came, so... M
Hey Meredith, how you feelin'?
Whoops.  Is that really what Ryan wanted you to tell us?
Actually it sounds like you are.
I was... mocking.
Yeah, I'm aware of that.  But he's also being super annoying.  And I'm not a perfect person.
Really?  Power gel?
Not sure.  Just became self-aware.  So much to figure out.  I think I am programmed to be your enemy.  I think it is my job to destroy you when it comes to selling paper.DunMiff/
Definitely not.  If anything it was a tie.
Oh I'm sorry.  What?
Sure we'll go.
You look a little worried.
How's it going?
What's going on?
Alright, let me just say good-bye to Pam.
Uh, that is an invitation to an online party.
That would be fun.
Oh.  Two kisses.
What was that?
Yep.  A long time ago, but, I liked it.
Oh actually I withdrew from consideration.
So, we should let him go.
What did he say?
I think you're under-thinking it.
As a hostage.
Yes, but not by kidnapping.
Michael just called the pizza place with a list of demands.
Which one's this? Perfect.
Yeah, cheese, or do we have other flavors?
What have we got here?
Hey, quick question.  If I take a pizza, do you think you could take some sodas and some napkins up to the roof?
Wow, can we make it a different moment?
That was the moment that you knew you liked me?
And that's when I knew. You?
That must have been extremely uncomfortable for your mom.
How long have you been a man?
Well it's just that you had no hair on Friday.
Do you run the bed and breakfest?
I wouldn't understand or a secret?
Where are you going out tonight?
That reminds me, uh, if the invitation still stands, Pam and I would love to have dinner tonight.
How are you doing this?
The Beets Motel? That is, wow.
Not even Harry Potter?
Yes. We will be requiring a bed time story.
Oh, I thought you asked me what our chances were in being murdered here tonight.
Good night, Dwight.
Oh yes. Ever since the storm.
Does Mose have nightmares?
No, sometimes its right.
Are you a cocktail waitress?
Maybe you should.
Have you checked Trip Advisor recently?
You will never want to leave your room.
The dawn goose walk will tug at your heartstrings.
Yeah, I mean she was with Roy, and, uh, I just couldn't take it.  I mean, I lost it Dwight.  I couldn't sleep, I couldn't concentrate on anything.  Even weird stuff, like food had no taste.  So my solution was to move away.  It was awful.  It was something that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and that includes you.
Yeah, I didn't think I had.  Well, it was all about Pam.
Did I ever tell you why I left Scranton?
Ah, dinner.  Let's see, maybe we should try the new Italian place, where the drive-in used to be.
Right back at ya.
Yes, they do.
I'm sorry, did we or did we not pay for a show?
You're doin' great, buddy!
Break me off a piece of that applesauce, I don't think...
You got it, you're so close!
Nobody tell him!
Oh it has losers.
Ah, show me how this works.
I... why don't we go back to this animation.
Not much, it's just for tracking Dwight so---  P
Oh, it's just my avatar guy. Whatever.
Why don't we take a quick ten second break from that so I can show you what's going on here.  Okay, this is Dwight's Second Life. He's on it all the time. So much so that his little guy here has created his own world. It's called Second Second Life, for those people who want to be removed even further from reality. P
Okay. Do you want me to stay?
Good morning.  Yeah I'm sorry, I looked away for a second and Creed snatched your hash browns.
I just thought you should---
Animation? All her by the way.
Okay, make a commercial.
Good!  Fine!  I've got one Andy Bernard that will direct this puppy for half your fee...
I'm just doing my job, man.
Okay, Scott, why don't you take your head out of the clouds and come back down to planet Earth so we can make a commercial.
You know what?
Love it. M
Mmmhmm.  Why don't you start by telling me what you got.
All right!   I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be doing, but...
Oh, I don't think that is what's happening.
So what are you going to do?
I'm not going to Utica right now.
We're going to Utica?
What are we doing?
Well, that kind of sucks, because it had all the photos of my brother's new baby on it, so...
Are you kidding me?
What are you doing? Stop it, Dwight!
No, I'm not calling Karen.
I can't believe you guys.  I'm not going to go further piss off my ex-girlfriend.
Are you kidding me?  We've been driving around with this stuff in the trunk the whole time?
No, no absolutely we are not doing this.
Alright.  Wait, what are you planning on doing?
You know what?  I'm just going to call a cab from here.
Pull over, pull over!
Michael! Michael, pull over!
Michael, watch the road!
Oh my God!
That doesn't make sense, couldn't be.
It doesn't matter.
Why don't we play that alphabet game that you were talking about?
Okay, you know what?
Shut up, you, shut up!  This is the dumbest thing we've ever done.
Oh my God, that's her! That's her, go, go, go.
Dwight, nothing with the eyes, please?
No, no, you won't do that. Nope.
Guy's going by. Shh.
No, Michael.  I'm not leaving the car.
No, no, don't do anything to them.
Okay, you know what?  You don't need to be updating me as much as you're updating me.
No, I'm not doing that!
No, I'm not doing that.
Oh my God, oh my God, Karen is back!
Damn it guys!
Okay! First of all, stop using my name.  And second of all-
No, that is a terrible idea, don't do this.
Isn't that thing huge?
You good?  I'm just checking on the other branches.  Michael wants me to do that from time to time, so...
First of all, hi.
Alright, you are welcome.  I'm going to go because of, um, traffic.
I mean, it's just that-  You know, Pam and I are still dating, so, and, I just mean that things are going really well, so I didn't want to see... you...
Oh no, I didn't want to see you.  Not that I'm not happy seeing you, right now, I'm just saying ultimately I was here for the copier.  Equal, I'd say it was equal.  So, good to see you...
Yeah, trying to quit though.
Are you inviting me to the Finer Things Club?
Angela.  Nope.  The ashes.
Of course I read it.
No, that wasn't fun.
Yep.  No, I mean I really liked it.  I thought was uh, a fun read.
Mmm... I'd prefer to sit in back.
Well, you're driving, right?
Okay, I will.
Well, yeah I don't want to see her get physically harmed, that's for sure.  P
I have to.  Pam, if I'm not there, someone's going to go to jail.  Or die.
Nnnno.  Uh, turns out, it was just a really bad idea involving fire.  But I think I fixed it.
You embarrassed me.  M
I thought we had that looked at.
Not gonna change.
Is there a limit?
That'd be great.
You know what, I have an idea. Why don't we just do one big shared party?
No... I think it's a great idea.
It's a pretty good idea, don't you think?
Right? I was just thinking...
Oh, sure. M
It will be Angela. C
Well, I'm gonna to talk to Angela and we're gonna see what we can do about a pie.
You want a birthday pie?
What do you want?
Well I think Meredith was just --
Hey, Andy, I have some calls to make.
Alright, I'll look into it, but the answer's no.
Not your birthday.
I remember that.
Is there anything --
Oh, thanks man. T
Yes, conference room in five minutes... No. No. We're gonna solve it right here. We're actually gonna talk about it out here. So, who has problems with the birthday thing?  One, two, three, everybody. OK, so then we just shouldn't do it. A
That's what she said.
That's what who said?
Well, I don't think I'll be here in ten years.
So, terrible idea.
Well, I tried to put all the birthdays together at once.
You have no idea. M
How much time do I have?
All right, let's run it back.
What, seriously? What is she saying?
Bring me players.
Dwight! Thank God you're here. As it turns out, one of our biggest clients is a ping pong master, and I have to play him tomorrow, or we lose the account. Can you help me out? Will you help me practice?
I think I'm ready.
Check this out though, spin serve.  Well, it works like 80% of the time, so...
Do you want to go play on the table upstairs?
What are you doing?
My friend's basement. All right, ready to start?
Oh yeah, how long's this meeting going to last?
What are you guys doing?
I think that's the question that you had...
Right. There, first...
Now, wait a minute.  You're not gonna punch a wall, or me, or anything like that if you don't win the point, are you?
Do you?  A
Good eye - it's an oval.   You're measuring the table.
I think you did.
Nope I don't, remember when you told us not to make plans 'cause we're working.
Oh, you guys doing a little construction?
Tour, let's do the tour first.
I have been getting ready and then driving over here.
Let's see, since I saw you an hour ago?
Really? 'cause... seems pretty narrow... and short.
Just like that.
Well, I saw - oh your Dundies. I'm surprised they're not out on the coffee table for everybody to see.
Michael, I'm just terrible at all this stuff, so that's really cool.
What is that chestnut?
What was that?
Not really a rhyme.
Oh, Dawson's Creek.
That's true. Um... dinner sounded delicious. Pam I'll see you at home, thank you so much.
I'm sorry, are you really trying to get us to invest in Jan's company?
Oh no she just put it in front of my face.
It's getting late.
Would you write down your e-mail because I have just so many questions...
So... how do you guys know each other?
Oh... my apartment's on f
For you babe.
You know, babe, I should have told you but... I did something bad.
I didn't have anything, Jan.
We should probably get back.
Oh today, we saw a junk yard dog attacking the bones of a rotisserie chicken.
So we had to park at a satellite parking lot over there.
Oh, well, that's coming.
You just got yourself kicked out of your apartment.
No, no, no.
What? My shoe is untied. What is your problem?  Oh my God, you thought I wa--- oh.
Hey Pam, will you wait for me one second while I tie my shoe? P
Yep.  Yeah.  She's blind, is that a problem? M
I actually know a sex model.
Nope. Not for you it's for your hair, and it is 9 am.
But best case scenario, you thought it was a quarter.
How'd you get gum in your hair?
Did I? I don't...
Well, I kinda feel like what we have going for us is our customer service, and no matter how we change this up, I don't know that a website's going to be able to replace that.
And then an older gentleman asked you "Boxers or briefs?"
Yeah, I actually have to agree with Dwight on that one.
I'm not single.
I'm gonna go to my desk.
Nice job everybody. Great work.
Nope. I didn't, but let's go inside and I can call him right now.
Is it Elliot? Hey ch... chief, this is Jim Halpert from um... where you work. You're the guy who sits behind the desk... you're, you're the, the Afri... African-American guy, I mean you're. Ah... Who, Who've I got here?
No guys his name's not Hank, it's ah, is it Edgar?
It's not, it's not Eddie, it's ah, Evan or...
It's ringing. Does anybody have his name? Quick.
Great, It's under here as Security Guard home. Did you not get his name? Or...
Will do.  I'll stop calling.
Haaank. Is that you?
I... just... if they speak Spanish. O
Is that... I didn't know that was your... okay, so we're in agreement, this is not ideal... situation.
Oh, I just mean if you, if you didn't lock the door, then we could be upstairs where it's warmer.
Let's be honest, it's not totally my fault.   Shared responsibility.
No, that was his wife, so he's on his way.
If you were a real star you would put your face in it.
Yeah that's true.
That's also not true.
And in this case...
Well that's not true. Other people believe it's deeper inside...
Greatness is only skin deep, some people say...
An urban thing...
What about if we did an even newer voicemail message that had even more zing and pep?
Well, it's too late, because I'm proposing... that you get me a cup of coffee, which would energize me greatly, and make me the happiest man in the world.
You know what would energize me? If you, Pamela Morgan Beesly...
I'm sorry, then do you mind explaining a little better? Cause I'm not sure what's really...
I'm sorry, is, is this because I talked to Wallace about your website? Because I really didn't mean to go over your head.
A formal warning...
On a wing and a prayer, mostly.
Oh we were just... talking about, bureaucratic stuff...
That's not a good idea.
Okay, you know what? Why don't you take my hand, and leave them, and let's get out of here.
She's never worn these glasses before.
Who else is he mean to?
Productivity?  My numbers are good.
Mr. Maguire, it's been a couple of years.Phil M
Absolutely, will do.
Now are you getting all your paper from PPC? Or-
You know, you can just pick it up, take the triple bogey.
Yeah. All right. Bye.  All right. Sorry, I got to annoy you one more time. What if I bring down shipping costs?
Oh, I like you.
Uh, you know, we'll see, we'll see.
Okay. You had some fun, and uh, I think I paid for it. So let me get my last shot in there. Is there anything you can do for me?
Thank you. You know what, screw this!  K
Thank you. Oh, thank you very much. Appreciate it.
I closed it!
Yeah, well, you know...Cornell.
Absolutely. We can get that out to you immediately.
And how many would you like?
Yes, we do have that. Hold on one second...
Hello, this is Dwight.
This is Dwight.
Can't do that. Unsanitary.
Oh, thank you. I've been working out.
Yes it is.
Hello, this is Dwight.
See how easy that is?
It's not a big deal. I'll come visit you. And you'll visit me. It's only two hours away. It'll be fine. That part's gonna suck, but it'll be great.
Wow. Busy morning.
Yes! So when do you start?
No way! What did I say? I said that they'd love those sketches. Congratulations!
All right, well it already went through, so...
No, I didn't. I just logged it in right here, so...
I know. Here, Michael, you can court her as you get to know her, you know? I mean, the office is a great place for that. Pam and I, we got to know each other right out there. I mean, the first time we joked around was at my desk. And the first meal we ever had was, in the break room, actually. We were at two separate tables and, I remember that. The first time we kissed even, was right outside, and... Look, all I'm saying is that you can get to know someone really really well, like I did, right here at work.
And that's really sweet. And you can think that. But you don't say that out loud, and you definitely don't say it to her.
Well, we're really happy.
Yes, we are still dating. And guess what? I took it slow.
We've been through this.
Actually, I think I am. And I have a little bit of experience in office romance.
Oh, okay, it doesn't work like that.
But you just met her.
Yes. You don't love Holly.
Okay. Let's start with the "I love you" level.
What are the two levels?
That's not it.
Well we all want a good party, right?
Because I'm gonna miss Toby. Yep, he's a heck of a guy, and I think we should send him off right. It doesn't matter. Here ya go.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I just meant I wanted to pay to have fireworks at the party.
There you go. There's plenty of base-laying left, right?... Hey. Hey!
Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.
Wow. Okay, so how'd that feel?
What'd you do?
Yeah, who'd have thought?
It's not my favorite...
Not my favorite, but...
I know. That's awesome, man. That's great.
He didn't mention me, did he?
So it's going great, sounds like.
Scared me.  How's the party planning going?
Good one?  That's a cool camera.
Okay, you could just say you don't know what's going on.
I'm gonna get a second opinion.
Do you honestly believe that?
Why wouldn't you see him?  You work for him.
Hey, Troy, can you do me a huge favor?  Next time you see Ryan, can you tell him to check his messages?  That'd be great.
I'll just go later.
Well, I tried.
But what have you learned about her?
Because most of the time, friends don't talk about other friends' butts.
No, I didn't.  You know why?
Ah, they moved the shower.
You have a cell phone charger.
You have a toothbrush.
Come on, man. She goes to New York in like 10 minutes.
Call me when you get in.
So what is going on, girl in the computer?
Cryogenics. Beer me five.
I would like to lose 65 pounds.
That's not what that is.
OK, thank you for ... this.
Maybe put up some shelves.
Nope, just going to see Pam.
Oh, that's so rude of me. Have you seen, um, Pam's new art? It's right there. Check it out.
But he did, right?
Well that's great.   You're talking about your court ordered community service?
No, you're definitely the problem.
How much weight have you lost, Dwight?
See, you're always saying there's something wrong with society, but... maybe there's something wrong with you.
I'm gonna write you up for not working.
Hey, can you go to IM?
Now he is saying "Hi" louder.
Dwight says "Hi."
I know.  I suck.
Hey, Michael.  I just scheduled lunch with a client so I might be back a little late.
Pam, will you marry me?
I just... couldn't wait.
What's up, Meredith?
Hey, sorry everybody.
No, you're not.
No, no, no, definitely, definitely.  Yes.  Next weekend, then.  All right!  I love you, too.
Hey, can you not?
To get married.
Thank you Angela.
OK.  You know what?  Here we go.  Uh, everybody?  I just want to make an announcement.  Pam and I are engaged.
I just didn't, you know, want a deal.
Ah.  That... they might be off the hook for because I... didn't tell them.
Why, what happened?
Alright.  I'll tell everybody here that you say hi.
Dwight, you've really never stolen any company time?
Personal conversation.  Seventeen seconds.
Oh you had said that you don't do anything personal during work time so... I'm just making sure.
Story's kinda bland.  It's about this guy named Dumbledore Calrissian who needs to return the ring back to Mordor.
You know, it's weird.  It's practically a shot for shot remake.
I mean I like all the crazy monsters and stuff.  You know, like klingons and wookies and all that but...  Sorry, was there something you wanted to add, Dwight?
Actually not.  It was really so-so.
By any chance, did you see Battlestar Galactica last night?
So maybe you're not completely ethical after all.
So I guess I can assume that was personal.
Oh, but you mean other than embezzling? R
OK, I'll ta...I'll talk to you later.   That was a good story.
Ha ha. That's hilarious?
Wait, who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Oh. Right, that style.
Right, the one from England.
What do we have here?
Oh. OK, well you know what, I um, just call me later.
The song is about losing your virginity next to a church, and guess what - she's been singing for the last twenty minutes!
OK, OK, so you gotta hear this.  So, Jan's shower is going on right now, and she's singing "Son of a Preacher Man" and everyone's just staring at her.
Hey!  You busy?
I miss you.
Wish you were home.  Uh, anyway... P
Yet here you are, back in a Laundromat.  Now, I'm just trying to help you, Beesly.  Be safe.
Remember that time that I helped you do your laundry and that crazy guy came in and started yelling at you?
Hope you didn't have any major laundry issues.
Is it me, or are we just a little off today?
Hey, it's me.  It is 5:03.
Oh yeah.  Wait 'til you get to know her better though.
We were robbed last night.
The future mother of my children.
I'm on minute six of this message.
So apparently Pam went out last night, and accidentally called my work phone at 3:00 in the morning.
Do you need us for any of this?
I'm good. How you doing?
Oh, I wouldn't-
Another round, boys? Great.
I can see that.
Yeah, I'd say she's happy. I mean, she loves her classes. Loves the city. I mean, last night, she was out with her friends, till, like, 8:00 AM.
Oh, thanks man. Appreciate that.
She's engaged, um... to me.
Yeah, she's doing really well.
She's, um, she's in New York. She's at an art school.
No.  You got that backwards.
Have you asked her what she wants to do?
I like the wild card.  I'm already liking the wild card.
Oh, that's good.
Let's move on to the next.
I think I got a pretty good sense of that one.
Let's start with the wildcard.
Ah, I'm sure they're all great.
Hey New York, Happy Halloween!
Oh, hang on one second. Jim Halpert.
You are?   A cat?
Oh, I'll walk you out.
Good to see you.
Hey, how are you? P
Wow, that's- that's a little rude. What's your deal?
That's not really true. There's a lot of things you can do with an art degree actually.
Guys, what is going on?!
Pam, don't worry about it.
Pete couldn't make the Mets. She's at Pratt. You played JV baseball. Will you lighten up a little bit?
Here you go again! What is your deal today?
Love that one.
That must be really fun for you and Marci huh?
Truthfully anything would have been better than that prank.  Oh, text message from my brother. "Pam cool. Welcome to the family."
Well, I'll be the judge of that. What do you got?
You wouldn't tell your mom?
Yeah, we'd never do that.
Testing, testing. Hello, everybody.
Yeah, I don't see it.
How can you even be sure?
OK. Or maybe I could finish the coffee that's in here and you could use  uh, oh -- Snoopy.
Oh, sorry. It was just -- it was right here.
You must be really proud.
I'm not talking to you.
I love you, too.
That is me. Wish me luck.
There's the charm.
Absolutely. Or you could just be nice to your customers.
Was it your scores?
How was your meeting with Michael?
It is... more of a spicy brown, actually.
Wow. That was Dwight. He seems upset about something.
Did my scores drop a little?
Michael, I'm just trying to --
I think you mean s
Well, there's got to be an explanation.
A little bit. ... Worth it.
You have to fire the salesman that treated me so terribly.
There is one condition, Michael.
Michael, I like the sound of your voice. You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to buy one million dollars worth of paper products today.
Well, this is William M. Buttlicker.
Well, I should hope so.  Who is this?
I'm irate right now.
The three words I would describe you as is aggressive, hostile and definitely difficult.
Now, you listen to me, sir.
Son, you have to talk louder.
You're gonna have to talk louder.
Sorry, you're going to have to speak up a little bit louder. I'm hard of hearing.
You know what? That's private.
Sorry. That was a family emergency.
Would you hold on one second? That's my other line.
How dare you? My family built this country, by the way.
I am Bill Buttlicker.
Wow, this is my lucky day.
Wow, that's great, because I need paper.
How many shoes do you need?
Is there some evidence?
The mob, maybe NASA.
What are you thinking?
In this car?
OK, what are you --
Are you serious?
No, she's not.
Let's just -- Let's head back to the desk.
I don't think so.
Hey, how are you and Darryl?
Well, we all handle it differently. I personally choose to handle it like a normal person, but...
Well, I can't be the only one who didn't --
I wasn't. But thank you.  Do you know anything about this party?
No. What party?
Well, Andy has a mug just like that.
Wait, that's pretty weird.
Do you have any reason to believe that Kelly would be mad at me?
You knew it the whole time, buddy.
You knew it.
You were right.
You were right.
That's what I'm saying.
Probably just Kelly.
OK, I'm gonna assume that was it. Here's the t
Is that it?
No, no, no, no. Dwight, Dwight, Dwight. Let's talk about this.
We called about a dozen customers, and they all said that they gave us great marks.
I'm gonna make a bigger leap here. He is into you.
That's it. I want to talk to this guy. Put me in his ear.
Oh, that's gonna be great. Who's Chuck Close?
We should take a look at those surveys.
You know what you should do? Take a vacation.
So, how you holdin' up?
Where is it?
Where are you going?
Why are you telling us this?
Six point five days.
Love you too.
And you went to New York to do this.  So when you come back you come back the right way. Right?
It's not--- It's not about me.  I mean, this your dream.
W---Wow. Um. Well... okay.
Okay, okay, it's no big deal.  So you're not a computer geek.
Wow. I thought you were good at Flash.
Are you sure?
I'm gonna grab a cup of coffee.
I missed you.
You should probably just meander back there; take a look.  See if he's, see if he's back.
You don't know.
Toby works here again.
She's probably going to, cause they sit next to each other.
Why is that, why is that weird?
So why did you come in here?
Yeah, I guess technically Kev, you're right.
That's really not cool.
Yeah, I am.  Wait, how do you know that?  I didn't tell you that.
Definitely we should.
Oh, it's on uh Linden Ave?  By the quarry?
Oh thanks, Phyllis.
Yes, I just have to take this call anyway so...
I'm always this close.
Oh totally.  Sorry, are we talking about the microwave still?
I bought it.  It's ours.  Let's go inside, I'll show you inside.
I have a surprise for you.  All right, ready?  Close your eyes and now  open your eyes.  Tadah!
Yeah, I can't... really can't move him.
No, No, we'll just board that up.  It'll be that weird spare room that people ask us about.
Yeah, I did.
Oh my God...
Uh, actually, I'm gonna go with copier.
You have to make the decision.
Beesly, are you threatening me?
Oh, Pam, I really... hate that copier.
Where we going?
Let's do it.
Mind if I join?
Woah, you guys going to lunch?
You look really pretty.
Ahh... I got you some tiramisu. No hard feelings.
Michael, that is hilarious.
You got it.
There they are.
Let me call you right back. Okay.
Yeah, you did win. You did win. Anyway, I'm going to need three copies of each of these, stapled and collated.
I think it'll take you a little longer than that.
Five minutes actually.  I am a black belt in gift wrapping.
Happy Holidays, Dwight. But do not open it till Christmas.
Stupid.  Everyone knows to ask for a hundred more wishes.  Dumb.
Can't believe no ones thought of that.
Wow, that is delicious.
What is it?
Well what if we can't do it quickly.
Ah... would you want to do it on Groundhogs day?
Michael, I think... you did the best you could, but this is bigger than all of us.
Yeah, but you're gonna need a permit for that.
Please stop. People are having a Christmas party.
Do you take requests? A
She knew it.
You knew it.
Everyone knew some of it.
You did not know it.
No, no, no, it's not your turn. All right, thirteen is the new number. Oscar, go ahead.
How about we just... Just have to talk to you for a second...
Why don't... Let's...
No, no. Nope.
We can't figure that out.
But you're leaving...
Well it's not too late, because you haven't done anything.
This shouldn't be coming from his boss. And we should also consider the fact that that man has an anger issue.
This shouldn't happen at work.
Dwight, I'm in charge when Michael's gone, and I need you to sit...
You're not going to do anything to his neck or his groin.
What are you standing for?
Hey. It is my business when it happens at work.
Okay, you know what? That's enough. Because...
Hey guys, why don't we, uh, just cool off a bit?
You okay, man?
Andy, are you all right?
Dwight! Are your legs broken?
Looks like a red wire.
Thank you, accounting department.
Okay, okay, okay. Why don't we just put this to a vote, and then we'll be done with it.
Guys, she is a beautiful movie star, so maybe we should just go to work.
Kevin, you know what, why don't you close your eyes? Imagine that Hilary Swank comes into this office for real and she walks over to you  Does that end the debate? K
No, no, no! Don't give him mouth to mouth for this! M
Okay, I am not dying here.  Come on.
How's that gonna help you?
Punishment fits the crime.
I mean, they just need to communicate, you know?  If they said to each other what they're saying to everyone else, then--
You couldn't of memorized that?
Mmm... nope, we mostly just talked about cereal.
Don't open your eyes.
Oh my God. Pam, I don't know, I, nothing, truly, nothing. I mean, I, I just was honest with him and I, I'm so sorry, I don't know. I'll call him again.
OK. 'Cause the quote was, cut off your nose to spiderface.
Do ya? M
He just sent a text... C
Yep. You're being replaced.
Are you alright?
I didn't, I'll look somewhere else.
What the heck? Is that, uh...
That's pretty funny. Hey you know what? Did I drop my, uh...
Whoa! What was that all about.
So this is fun.
Party planning is literally the stupidest thing I have ever done in my life.
Basically after Phyllis blackmailed Angela, Michael asked them to both step down from the party planning committee cause there was too much drama.
Guys guys guys guys guys guys. We just want to make it up to you. What can we do?
I said I was working on it.
I am working on it.
Okay, good then.
I can't believe how bad this looks.
Not even an exclamation point?
Dwight. This,  fits in the palm of my hand. You haven't blown 'em up enough. Why have you chosen brown and gray balloons?
Do you think I'm calling you for your best approximation?
Look, I'm at the supermarket, and they only have numbered candles. How old is she?
It's Mose. Who do you think it is?
How old's Kelly?
How do you hate it? It's a cake.
And... ta da.
Hey, you know what? I got you a cake.
Hey, Dwight, sounds like she was 14, so maybe we wanna go a little easy. D
Got it. D
Hey! What the hell's goin' on?
Okay, you know what, next time, I'll let you get the cake and I get to scream at the birthday girl.
You've been making that sign, for something that we could just announce to the whole office? Hey everybody, the party's now at 3!
We have a lot to do, and you are... putting up a very effeminate sign. Is that what you've been doing, is making a sign?
You know what? I could use a little help.
Hey, what's that show that she's always talking about?
Didn't see that one coming.
Actually, when I was seven, my Dad took me to the Natural History Museum in New York. And we looked at fossils all day. And at the end of the day, he got me a little plastic triceratops. It was awesome.
Okay, stop. Forever stop that story. That's disgusting, and it doesn't count. So give me another one.
Look, is there a birthday you remember that you loved?
Okay, so far, our ideal party consists of beer, fights to the death, cupcakes, blood pudding, blood, touch football, mating, charades, and yes, horse hunting.
I'm not writing, "Horse Hunt." I don't even know what that means.
Ahem. This is for you... and  ...Happy Birthday, Kel.
Because the fun part is, you get to decide on an hour of television, or an hour of napping.
That's the best part. That represents a pillow, or a television.
You haven't heard our theme, though.
What?! You have a cake. You have a delicious cake, with your name spelled correctly?
Not a surprise.
Nice to meet you, yeah.  Whew!  I can assure you we don't need a new system though.  Happy with ours.
Michael Scott, manager.  Hi, how are ya?
Yeah.    She's fine.
That sounds fun.
Uh, I actually thought we were keeping it pretty low-key.
I understand that. D
Oh, I'm sorry.
Yes, let's have a word.
I have a lot of work to do this afternoon.  Those mines aren't gonna sweep themselves.
Nobody asked, Bob!
But! That girl must've had monstrous hands because the holes fit.
No.  Bob, no. No!
No way, a 280?
Look at that.  Bob ordered hot food. P
I think if you ordered hot food you're allowed to eat.
Well they didn't dine so, yeah, maybe they just dashed.
Oh great, I have to cover?
No, just kidding.  Seriously though, that's enough.
Oh initially I did.
The KGB will wait for no one!
Ding dong. D
We own our own delivery trucks. We could lease them out on the weekends --
Why don't you just go out on a date with her? Try to spark up an on going joke and then in a month or two, if it feels right, you'll know. A
Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec, Tom, what's that? You found five golden tickets? And does it say limit one per customer? Nope, it doesn't.
...well I'm going to call corporate to make sure that they know I didn't lose half my sales.
Good one. M
Absolutely not, I'm mad at you.
No, stop it.
No, that is what I mean.
All I'm saying is that it's a first dates, so just keep a respectful distance. K
There it is.
You, you are taking about Dwight Schrute. The biggest Wonka fan I know. I mean, you've been talking about that movie for years.
I get back from work around 6.
Yeah, I'm late for work, so I have to brush my teeth, it's a whole routine. D
Alright. I just got out of the shower, I'll be one second. D
And of course, classy.
I just feel like after fifteen years at this company, bravo by the way, that we should celebrate with a very classy event, a night to remember.
I don't know. Is it classy enough?
Ok, well let's just try this one on for size. And I apologize because it's right off the top of my h
Oh, Dwight, you're trying too hard, and that's just not classy. You see, the thing about classy is it's a state of mind. D
That's it. Or Mr. Peanut.
Nope. I mean, I could have brought a change of clothes, or-
Really wish you would have told me the new boss was coming today.
Jim Halpert, yep. So, um, just going to let you get back to it...
Oh, you'd understand if you read the memo which I should probably get you, there's probably one in a drawer... uh. It was pretty crazy. But, uh, not more crazy than wearing a tux, at work, I grant you that... so, uh.
I didn't think you'd notice.  Uh, it's funny actually, there's another salesman out here, Dwight Schrute, and he sent out this memo, as he always does, and, uh, it was about professionalism in the workplace. Of course, he singled me out. So I just had to mess with him. C
I thought it'd be funny.
You pet the animals and they pet you back. M
No, I would like to get back to work, actually, please. C
No, not exactly.
Assistant regional manager, yeah.
Oh, that's because at first it was a made up position for Dwight, just to make him feel better, assistant to the regional manager. But then he lost that, and Michael gave it to me.
Second-in-command to Michael.  C
Alright, Charles, I've gotta be honest. I think we really got off on the wrong foot here. And, truth be told, I'm a pretty smart guy, and, uh, a hard-worker.  And a great number two for the office.
Right, cause that's what we are talking about.
Yeah... .you want me to come in your office?  Oh.
I didn't... no.
Nothing, just talking.
Here's the thing.  What I wish for you is that you land a job at a company that A, exists, and B, has a salary.  Because they're set up to do that kind of thing.
And you are not going to, either.
Do you know the industry is in decline?
You're starting your own paper company?
I would prefer not to.   M
I'll bring your stuff home. Okay, bye.
Michael, its not how you leave in an office. It how you... M
Pam! You can't be serious.
Well it is tempting but I am 100% leaning towards something else.  M
I did have a chance to think about it, but then I thought about something else.
Here we go.
It is transfer, extension, and then transfer again.
No.  Stay there. Kev, thought we nailed the whole transfer thing earlier. K
Oh no. I was just - C
No it's not.
You're breathing very heavily.
Would you please stop that?
Let's... eh... see ya.
Maybe we will someday.
Well, maybe you should get back to work.
It's 'cause I'm more of a player.
Uh, no. Nope. Not really. C
Aw, it's gonna be the  worst.
Oh, there he goes.
Alright! Let's do it.
I'm sorry, Phyllis.
Okay, I'm just gonna go get some ice.
You realize you're not actually talking to me, right?
Yeah. Gotcha. Of course. I'm gonna dive in. To the rundown. I'll be exhausted 'cause it's like a triathlon.  Do you want to close this? Close, or keep it?
No. I can't. It was like, hours ago.
"This rundown better be really good"?
"Uh, can you get this rundown for me?"
No. Not too hard. Not harder than I should.
Keeping it simple -that's what I'm doing. But I am working hard on this one. Real hard.
Hey you know what? Do you have a rundown that I could take a look at, just so I know what type of rundown you're looking for ?
I will get back to the rundown, uh, right now.
Oh, this is just something I'm taking a break with.
The one I have. I'll use the one I have.
No. No, I just wanted to make sure, it was in the same format. So that distribution list is gonna be my...?
Yeah sure. You want to look at it first?
Anyway, now we are going bargain hunting in the haunted graveyard of their love.
I am extremely interested. So, how much will all of this cost?
It's so scary how right the things you're saying are. And you're coming at it with almost no knowledge, so of course I trust your opinion on this.
Am I going down a road?
I think she just didn't want a crucifix cake.
You know that I was doin' this.
It's just that Pam gets me through the day, you know? I really rely on her. I'm pretty emotionally needy.
-I just don't know if I can do it.
I said forget it.
Why? When I look in the mirror, I don't like the face that looks back.
Yeah, well, with you it's different, okay? Cause I just- I just suck. I just- I suck!
I just totally blew a sales call.
Oh, God. A
And two, that stuff that happened with you and Angela is a bummer, and I know you don't think you're ever gonna find someone else, but you will. I promise you, you will.
Two things I need you to understand. One, Pam and I are very happy together. A
When I think of it like that, I do not think of the other connotations.
Will you just talk to them, please? Pam just knew!
Everyone. Everyone just keeps looking at me.
Are they looking at me?
Oh, they're my client.
Hey. I saw you called.
Oh, okay.  Don't worry about it.
Good, right?  Hello.
Oh, yeah. Only this time we will be okay.   Oh, that's my new "Dwight" ring.  P
You're just out of business? P
Okay, so I'll be back in, um-- back in a bit.
I mean I guess-- I guess I could go down there and try to nudge them in the right direction.
Oh, but you didn't.
Missed the last part.
Three yeses.  I will see you titans of industry upstairs.
David Wallace has asked me to come down here and see if you would be interested in Dunder Mifflin buying you out.
Actually here for something else.
Hey, can I talk to you guys for a second? M
Because you've solved zero cases.  D
What are your top five cases?
No, I mean, great detective work.  'Cause this must be the first case you've ever cracked, right?
Great work Dwight.
Hey, you have a second?
Sure.  Let me just finish this turn.
Then why would you want to set me up with your daughter?
Take it easy.
All right.  You're right, sometimes when she's tired, she can be a little bit shrill.  But that's not a weird voice.  M
And I won't.
That's not true.
He definitely stole my iPod.  M
Eh, she's nice, I guess.  You know what?  Best thing to do, Pros and Cons list.
I don't want to be biased, but I am very close to Ryan.  You know that.  M
Ok. Right. Oh, so this morning we are having breakfast together and I just looked up from my cereal and I said, " You know what I want to do today? I want to marry you."
Very expensive. Cause you say you want a small wedding and that's great but then you have to invite -
Ok. So, we're going through all the wedding plans and, boy, it is complicated.
So, it turns out it's the closest place to get a marriage license without a 3 day waiting period.
That makes sense.
Yeah. At least for one more dance.
We're gonna stay.
Wait, should I have left the car running?
Oh, right, some drunk guy hit on Pam last year. Said he was grabbing her for balance.
I had this huge spider in my baseball mitt.
Come on, who doesn't like a picnic?
No, I shouldn't have to ask you to do stuff like that. You should just do it.
I don't get it. He's not even my boss anymore.
Hey, how are you?
Well, I could've died, so... I looked it up online afterwards.
Nice job, Beesly.
All right, you know what?  Let's do this.
All right, you know what? You're just trying to get rid of our best player.
Hey, easy, easy...
You all right?
This... is Parkour.  The goal is to get from point A to point B as creatively as possible, so technically they are doing Parkour, as long as point A is delusion and point B is the hospital.
What are you gonna do about it? There's no shotgun, so... free at last, free at last!
No shotgun... 'cause that changes everything.
Wait, there's not gonna be a shotgun?
Well, with her being unmarried... knocked up by some guy, I mean the yakity-yaks in this office would have a field day.
I did. From you. You gotta stop telling people.
You have to stop this.
You're gonna regret that when you find yourself between a moose and her cubs.
I didn't tell anyone! Who did you tell?
So, they know.
Can I talk to you for a second?
And a man.
You gotta have sex with a woman.
Are you... interested in her guy friends?
Oh, I don't really do that. But Pam might have some friends, though.
Yeah, sure, but... who's been saying all that stuff?
Hey, has everyone heard a crazy rumor about themselves today?
If everyone would like to see proof.
Okay. Thank you.
That sounds terrible.
You can't do this.
Don't take it.
I did. It was inconclusive.
Michael, we only told our parents last week.
Ah, this is just me and David, if that's okay.
Who was that?  M
You will?  Wanna do it right now?  M
How many times have I asked you to put me up for a branch manager job.
No, not without a "please."
Ah, ah, ah. Where's the "please"? We're not animals.
If you stop crying, I'll stop writing it.
I'm just gonna write "held back tears."
Did you feel like crying?
Did you cry?
All right. Did he hit you?
Okay. And how do you feel?
Okay. Just want to let you know I take complaints very seriously. So... When did this happen?
I'm sorry to hear about that. Who is this about?
Can I talk to you in my office for a second?
How about this? I think our goal should be we don't have meetings unless they're absolutely essential. M
You mean on a weekend?
Yes, I agree. M
Okay. Yesterday, we had a meeting about planets.
And I'm wondEring if perhaps those are a bit, um--
Thank you. I've noticed we've been having a lot of conference room meetings. M
That's not what I meant.
Michael, this is a conference room meeting.
Okay, Michael, I thought we agreed to not take up people's time with meetings like these.
Really? Hey, Stanley, what was the last thing Michael said before I came through the door?
Alright. Let's get started.
Nope, not at all. M
David, I know that I'm very new at this, but I have a very good perspective on how things work. David W
Hey, David. You got Jim here.
Pro-- no favoritism. M
Con-- no one gets as much as they did last year.
Yeah. Okay, so for the 1.5% increase, pro-- everyone gets a little bit. M
You just came up with that.
I'm sorry, are you advocating that I use it less?
It's hard to tell so far.
Okay. You know what would help is a pros and cons list for our options. M
Do you mean, like break-in in the middle of the night and change the numbers on payroll?
Wow! I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit, so...
Okay, Dwight, you know what? You'd be getting the raise so--
Really what it is, is about the money the sales staff brings into the office.  K
Look, you guys are smart, so I'm just leveling with you. I'm just trying to treat you like adults. O
But maybe I'm here for a reason, because I might have some good ideas, too. I've been sitting out there, and I've been learning a lot, and maybe I can just bring something different to the table. M
I don't think you're good at making tough decisions!
No, it's because you also have a lot of weaknesses, Michael!
But there is a reason why I'm here!
Look, you have a lot of strengths.
Nope. I'm numbering the paper.
He's not a part of this. You know that. M
I was just trying to be unbiased.
Michael's my only friend left in the office. Except Pam... I think. Is she still upset?
Uh, on a scale of one to ten, I'd say I'm about a four.
We would really appreciate it.
It is really special.
Absolutely. 'Cause not everyone knows and some people may be offended.
No. This is a fire cracker free wedding.
Click. Oh, you blinked. Damn it. Now that's in my brain forever.
Oh, wow. That's cool.
I don't like that.
I know. We're pretty excited, too.
Pretty sure everyone heard that.
Michael, I thought we discussed that we would rather you not speak, like, at all. Because it's just going to be blood relatives, I think.
Mom, Dad. This is Michael Scott.Mr. H
Dad, remember, no mention of the baby, right?Mr. H
Oh. Is this, uh, is this your niece?Mr. B
Oh, my God. Please.
Pam can't drink? I didn't-- I shouldn't have said that. I don't know why I did. She can do whatever she wants, though she shouldn't. She shouldn't because she's an alcoholic. Pam is an alcoholic. That's not true. I-- no. What we want-- the real reason is that, that Pam's pregnant.
I've been driving stick since high school. So... yes. For a really long time that's all I had. I just had little moments with a girl who saw me as friend. And a lot of people told me I was crazy to wait this long for a date with a girl who I worked with, but I think even then I knew that... I was waiting for my wife. So...  I would like to propose a toast. So if you'd all raise your glasses. Not Pam, for obvious reasons, but everyone else. If you would raise your glasses--
Aw, thanks, Pete. That was really nice. I just want to say how happy we are that all of you are here tonight. And I want to especially thank those of you who traveled from far away to be here with us tonight... especially the Flordia cousins who, obviously, can't take a hint.  Four years ago, I was just a guy who had a crush on a girl who had a boyfriend. And I had to do the hardest thing that I've ever had to do... which was just to wait. Uh, don't get me wrong. I flirted with her. Pam, I can now admit in front of my friends and family that I do know how to make a photo copy. Didn't need your help that many times. And do you remember how long it took you to teach me how to drive a stick?
Alright. Hey, everyone. Thanks for coming.
Oh, my God. Are you serious?
I'm so sorry.
Is there something about being a manager that makes you say stupid things?
I can't believe it was me.
No. Let's talk for a long time.
I love you.  Okay, I gotta--I gotta go!
Pam, it just happened.  P
Look, I would so take him in any other circumstance, but I'm pretty certain I'm completely wasted.
That's not how that works.
Is this allowed?
There.  Now we're even.
Hey.  You look just as I imagined you would.  Pam, you're so pretty.
So beautiful.  Hey--
Wow.  You look--
I  at the Bermuda Triangle. An-  M-  please don't call again.
And you'll be saved.
Just  and then you'll be saved.
And then you'll be saved.
All you're gonna need to  and-  it- and then go to--
I'm gonna help you through it all right?
How did you get this number? Michael, we're on a catamaran. M
Wow, that's... really thoughtful of you, Dwight, thank you. D
Do we have a conversation scheduled?
Okay, so we're good.
Then take a different way home, man! M
Don't call her "the mom."
No, not more than anything. M
Not now, Toby, my God!
Oh my God. T
Okay, never tell Pam, and secondly-
Oh my God.  Oh my God. M
What kind of car does she drive?
You did not have sex with Pam's mom.
You're messing with me.
You know what, I am really slammed, trying to catch up on everything here and I know that Michael's slammed too. So, maybe we should do this when things are a little less crazy. P
You know what? Can I have the weekend to decide?
Okay, back to the old grind.
Just take the parrot.
Yes, you do.
Uh, I think we should just drop it... 'cause obviously he doesn't want to talk about it.
Oh, so Dwight gave me this wooden mallard as a gift, and I found a recording device in it. Yes. So, I think if I played it just right I can get Dwight to play out the plot of National Treasure.
Who wants a hot chocolate?
I was gonna go with this one.
Remember that older couple whose kids were also named Jim and Pam?  P
Yes. I am the popular social networking site known as Book Face.
Alright. Let's clear this up.  Well, there's actually been a few changes in the company and Michael and I are actually at the same level. So, I can- no. Nope. Why would that be a problem?
That is a mistake.
Oh. Actually, it's just gonna be me.
I bet we would.
I absolutely don't understand, either.
They said that they would feel more comfortable if you came along.
Yes, it is.
Yeah. I've spoken to them on the phone.
I'll just leave that suit in your office then.
I outran it.
Mmm... it's like Michael said. It was some- something else.
Ok. Great meeting, everybody. That's it.
Really? Do it. I am a big, stupid goofball.
Maybe if you make fun of yourself it'll all go away.
Mm... I'm, know what? Maybe we should go easy on Michael, guys. You know, you watch that tape and you're gonna have to stay late for more sensitity training, so... K
I didn't ask you.
It's a killer new dance move.  Do you wanna talk in your office?
Oh... man. I thinke when I started to see you go in I think I just froze.
Oscar, yes. You're right to stop it. Thank you. Eject it.
What are you doing?
Guys. Michael can't handle this and as your boss I'm saying we're not watching it.
That will inevitably lead to mocking. So... P
What happened to 'Do Not Mock'?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ok. Yeah. We're not watchin' this.
That's okay.  P
Rarely.  If ever.  Let me give it a whirl.  I'll talk to them. P
Oh man, that's crazy.  Right as we were on our way out too.
Oh, burn.  Burn on you... and a little bit on me, too.  M
You set the bar so high.
Penny for your thoughts.
No more than a week.  Maybe two weeks.  M
But at the same time she looks crazy and I do understand her reasoning.  M
She wants it bad Michael.
All the time.  M
You two are so evenly matched I don't know how one of you is going to get the upper hand.
Oh my God, he's making you look like such a fool.
So let's just say that Dwight has come at you with the throat punch.  Now how would you, Dwight, defend against it?
OK, with all due respect to everyone here, I think the most worthy opponent of you is you.
OK, so there's no defense for that, good to know.
Are you serious?
That rhymes, so what have we on the docket today?
I thought we agreed that we wouldn't do things like this.
And what Designing Woman are you basing that on?
OK, I'm going back to work.
No, you're not reopening the case.  The case is closed.
Oh, hey, Michael. Listen, I brought up those sales targets.  Do you want to-
Alright guys, it's a work day and you guys work here, so let's go do some work.
Both.  They're both worse.
Or maybe he's just stuck in character.
Michael, not now.
Michael, can I talk to you in your office?
I'll take it.
Sure.  Oh, you know, while I have you... today I was working on this pitch for a supermarket chain, and it would actually be a big account and I wanted to-
Conference room everyone.
Well there is some bad news.   There has been another murder.
Yeah, I want to go home.
God bless you, Recyclops. And your cold robot heart.
Nah. Might as well do it now.
Maybe we should just wait and find out.
Could go either way.
But if the company doesn't go under then we'll finally have all our contacts in one program.
I am just as much of a boss as Michael and I can do anything that Michael can do. Alright?  Who here believes that I have as much power as Michael?
Who here heard it from Ryan?
Ok. Who else has heard the rumor that I am not as much in charge as Michael?
Well - who? How did you? Who, who told you this?
I care about them and I'm just as much of a boss as Michael.  What's so funny? I'm a co-manager.
Ok. You shouldn't be telling me that stuff and also shouldn't be taking two hour lunches without telling me.
Well, that was apple-picking day and there's no need to yell that day, you know. I was just excited to find the car. Perfect end to a perfect day. P
Oh, well I yell. You've heard me yell.
To be honest, I don't know, but maybe I could just yell at him in front of people. P
But, you know what? I came up with something and I think it's really gonna help.
I think I know the problem.
You know what?
Simple data entry, though. So there's really only one way to do it.
Let me show you what I mean.  Your new office. How great is that, right? For a job well done. Well, not done. R
Hmm, sounds risky.
Wow, what do you put our chances at?
Wait, are you the patient or the doctor?
It would look bad.  Sorry.
You're not in it at all, because you can't be employee of the month, you're a manager.
Great.  Hey, how do you feel about starting an Employee of the Month program?
I think she's okay.
Did you murder someone?
Hey.  What's up?
That's okay, I'll do it.
Okay, if it's all the same to you, I'm just going to take away "Survival Skills" and "Self-defense."
Well, in an ideal world...
Let me guess, you think you should get it.
You're creeping me out.  I'm gonna go.
No, Dwight, I meant... Yes, in a perfect world, someone would get money.  But-
Will everybody stop for a second, because obviously I'm not taking any of it.  A mistake has been made and we'll figure it out.  Second of all, there was no cash prize.
Guys, listen.  This was anonymous, all right?  There is no way I could've given it to myself because I didn't even know who was on here.  I just gave it to the employee with the highest overall score.
Okay, wait, I was not... I did not-
Okay.  That is me, but I didn't order the cake.
I really don't know how it happened, David.
So there was a little bit of a miscommunication here today.  It's been a little wild, uh, but I am on it.
Hey, uh David.
Yeah.  Thank you.
All right, it will not happen again.  I promise.
Too, too loud. Too Loud.
Too loud. D
We didn't, because we think it'd be better to do it together.
Three, two, one!
Why would you start so high? D
No, it's not "ugh." It is... office camaraderie.
This is all we have.
Hey, Creed, we covered it. Lump of coal!
I'm not gonna go tell Phyllis that she can't be Santa.
I think she's doing a good job.
No, I'm not gonna do that.
Yeah I told her a long time ago she could do it.
What would Bob do?
That's what I want.
I'm trying Phyllis. You're Santa.
And if you want Michael as Santa, raise your hand.   Can I get you some punch?
Who wants Phyllis as Santa?
Michael, it's Phyllis. We want Phyllis as Santa.
You can't yell out "I need this, I need this" as you pin down an employee on your lap! M
Can I just talk to you for a second?
Hey hey hey. Everything okay? M
Not great. You heckled Santa for an hour and a half.
No, you won't, because he's not picking up his phone.
Okay. We haven't gone under. We've been sold and that can mean many different things.
Michael, wait. So they said we are sold?
Wait wait wait, who said that?
Oh my God, David. That's horrible.
Oh my God!
But if not, there's always the army. The infantry.
Turns out, a lot of parents want the very best for their children. That's weird.
I don't know. I don't know.
I just walked in on someone in the bathroom.
Oh. Adorable, right?  I walked in on someone in the bathroom.
What if we just bring it up? We just put it out in the open?
We should just go. He's really uncomfortable.
No, no, no, no. Yes. We saw this, yes. No, it wasn't like a look around. We really just had a peek. Quick peek. Didn't focus on anything in particular. P
This is great. Got to confess, we came a little early, so we got a quick look around, but, uh -
Oh, this coming from the guy who still uses a children's toilet? Why didn't you just lock the door, man?
Did it? It might have come up while we were waiting for you. J
Oh, no, sorry. Just, um, we're kind of planners. But we're also flexible too, so you know what? Maybe we can just discuss it when the time comes. J
Do you even know what that means?
I... Why would you just say something like that?
I don't think so.
I'll take over. Um, what we're doing h
This is way more than I make now.
Exactly that. I think that you absolutely deserve the manager position more than I do.
Why would you do that?
No, I really, really think Michael is better at being manager for so many reasons.
You gotta do something, man. You can't just sit there.
Yeah. Thank you.
For now, I'm just gonna go back to work here...
Why would I wanna do that?
Oh. I'm fine. Thank you, though.
What is that?
That's it. I think we should do it the Lethal Weapon way.
Hey, what was that movie where their boss was within earshot and they could've just gone and talked to her.
For the record, I fought this. Alright? And now, I'm not really sure what we do.
Well, it's what you wanted.
Well, the grass is always greener.
Michael's saying he's better at being manager, and I agree, cause he's a better people person, weirdly.
Hey, did I tell you we were going to have a baby?  Oh, thank you very much.  I'm excited.  Oh, definitely.
Not to mention the extra night's sleep in the hospital will be very nice because once we bring the baby home, if it's crying all night, one of us is going to have to take care of it.  And I do not plan on helping unless it's a boy.
Yeah, we're slow-playing it because of our stupid HMO.
Because the insurance company only covers two nights.
Hmm, that logic's air-tight, but unfortunately it wasn't conceived here.  Burning man, port-o-potty.
Michael, you shouldn't have done that.
Okay, but we are leaving at five minutes apart.
I...  Pam, please.
Are you serious?  Pam.
Okay, I feel like this noise is going to prevent Pam from being able to listen to her body's signals.
You know, it's getting real crowded in here.  Maybe you guys should all go back to work because the day's not out yet.
Well not until Friday 20% off toner cartridges, that's a big deal.  While we're on the subject, why don't I just run you down to the hospital and we'll just do a quick check?
Okay, crazy.  I think I have some better things to do with my day than worry about you, like sell printers.
Oh!  Oh, alright.  That's a good one.
Oh, and by the way, hate that you're helping her with this right now.  Totally.
No, I don't.
Great.  I will do that.  Sorry, Pam, I just feel a little bit frazzled.  And you know how very rarely I use that word.  Frazzled.
Mm-hmm.  Okay, great.  Well, sorry.
Nope, nope, nope, nope.  Come on, let's go to the hospital.  Pam, let's go to the hospital right now.
Okay, you know what?  I'm going to go give, uh, doctor Asmani a quick call.  He'd probably know...
Alright...  Hey, did you change?
Woo, alright.  Well, I definitely feel better.
Wow, we're having a little girl.  Oh, man.
Mad?  How could I be mad?  We're having a little girl.
Did you say "she?"
Yeah?  ...  Oh.
Ah, you know me too well.
We waited too long!  Two minutes doesn't do us any good.  Well, what happened to four and three minutes?
No, I told you to warn me at five minutes.
Michael, I told you.
How are we doing on contractions?
So let's have it at the hospital.
A really awesome baby.
The best news is, we're going to have a baby today.
Pam, I'm scared.  I'm real scared.
If anyone can do this, you can do this.
Hey, are you kidding me?
You know what?  Let's go.  We got to go to the hospital.
Pam, Pam, it's time.  Let's go to the hospital.
Hey, come on.  Let's go to the hospital.
Let's give it a shot.
Alright.  Time to go.  Okay.
Okay, I can't find my keys!  I cannot find my keys!  Found 'em.  They're here.Dwight, Jim and M
Go bag's in the car...  Keys, my keys, where's my keys?
Alright, I have my wallet.
Alright, we're driving ourselves, actually.
Okay, Michael!  Focus!
Michael, come on!
Pam, no!  Are you nuts?  We're going to the hospital now.
Okay, so what do you want to do?
Okay.  I know, I know.  But my iPod is in the go bag.  We'll be fine.
Michael, just go park the car.
Wait, you alright?
No, don't push.  Pull.  Pull.
Doing great, push again.
Oh, my God!  Look at her!  baby, she's so beautiful!  Oh, my God.
No, let's let her rest.  I'm sure there's still twelve on each.
She's seven pounds, two ounces, eighteen inches.  Mother and daughter are doing great.
Her name is Cecelia Marie Halpert.
Oh.  Let me get it.
Hey, grandma's back.
It's so weird, she was saying it just before you got here.
I think we'll be okay.
We were just kids.  What did we know?
I got it.  Alright.
I can't.  She's too strong.  She's, careful, though.  You don't want to break it.
Ha ha.  No, yeah, that will be good.
It's going to be alright.
Oh!  Really?  Must have sat on it, Pam.
I think you're good.  Doing a good job.
Wasn't it...  It's kinda like a...  Like that.
Well, you're pushing the milk out, right?
You see that?  I'm pretty sure she's...  Hi.
Careful...  Wow, she just shoves the nipple right in there.
Okay, I'll just go get the other guy.
No need.  I saw him do it.  I can try it.
Oh, uh, try the torpedo thing.
We'll figure it out.
I think she will.
Are you sure it doesn't hurt?
Yup.  Really great.  When's she available?
Or it could be a half hour, if you need it to be...  Can we get a late checkout?  I don't...  I don't think she heard me.
Newsflash, the whole thing needs to go in the car.
Yes, car seat's right there.
We definitely are.  At 3:00, right?  You said we could stay until 3:00?
Ha ha ha.
Right, okay.  Yes, that would be the smart thing to do.  Uh, Pam, I will be right back.
Uh, it's in the lot.Hospital e
But you hear the baby crying, right?Hospital e
You used my move, didn't you?
Five tickets on the windshield...  Hey.
Okay.  Just gotta...
What do we got here?
Oh, thank you!
That's a common mistake.
Is that what happened to you?
Oh it's tough being here for a lot of reasons.
Pretty amazing. D
It is. Big time. D
Okay. Love you. We'll talk soon.
That would be great, thank you.Andy and D
No, we definitely can talk about it in the next--Andy and D
Yeah.Andy and D
Whether it's this time or next time.
Can you grow up? D
Please stop that!
When's the last time you upgraded your printer?
Yeah that's great. Great.
Thanks again by the way.
You know I will. And by the way, seriously, we never, never do this!
Hey Jo, it's Jim Halpert. I actually scheduled a meeting at 7:30 with a very important client. And it's so weird, because we never have meetings after 5pm. But I was hoping that maybe just this once, it would be okay.
Oh my God. We're going to have to re-name it then aren't we?
No, it's not. They call it Quad-Desk. D
M. Night Shulman?
...in your condo complex.
I had a little better reason to believe that... You're right. You're right. Well, you're not right, because Johnny Depp...
At the Yankees game. Yeah.
Captain Crunch. M
Sure. That they should do one.
Oh my God, that's right. I read in People magazine that he was looking for a two-bedroom condo in Scranton. M
Where did you take that?
Is he you?
That's good. You know, with the kid.
You writing your name over there?
This is actually a big potential sale, so...
Oh, sorry, wait one second.
What'd you get?
I don't think you understand - M
Ahh, these aren't leads. What are they? M
Alright. So why don't you just give me my share of the leads, and I'll start making some calls?
So I'm going to go ahead and save you some time, and tell you that no-one's going to go along with this. But you knew that, right?
Oh my god, I couldn't envy you more.
I am currently reading incoherent riddles on blue index cards to find vital information that Michael has hidden all over the office. How are you?
It involves you too. D
Michael's stupid scavenger hunt.
She's wearing a onesie
I have new baby pictures.
Oh, good, phew,  thank god you said that.
Just all the - drama.
Didn't we kind of start it?
Alright. Then we're back to cash. And I got to say, if giving a small percentage of our commissions is going to smooth all this over, I'm for it.
Pam texted back saying we could give them all iPods.
I'll text Pam. She's really good at this stuff.
Yes! We do.  Eclairs.
No, no - this is a representation of how we feel. And how we feel i
19.  I had a really hard work out this morning.
I made a sale.
I did not see this coming.
You've been gone for a long time.
Would you like to be our fourth?
Oh, hey, Pam and I are gonna go play pool with one of her friends, and we need a fourth.
About you two hitting it off.
So Pam was right?
So you like her?
Hey, you're supposed to hit the white ball first, buddy. Nice one. Can I talk to you for a sec? All right. Everything ok?
What is happening?
Michael, you don't have to do this.
Maybe it should come from a note... with flowers...tomorrow.Bar M
All right. P
You all right?
I literally did not know that existed until this moment. D
Dwight, don't be gross. P
"Sorry, Gabe, but that show hasn't been on in many cookies."
Oh, guys. I really refuse to participate. "Michael, can I have an advance on my paycheck because a Mrs. Fields Cookie just opened up at the mall." G
I think you need to go a little easy. You can't just suspend someone form work.
Yeah, I mean, the Count has a very distinct voice.
Buenos dias, Miguel. Como estas? Bien? Claro que si! Yo estoy fantastico. Que pasa? M
That's a good point.
Yeah, or maybe we don't even need that. M
How are you?
None of this is time sensitive. M
Hold on one second.
Well, maybe you shouldn't try to kiss people at work. M
Pam, you know he's not gonna get anywhere, and he's gonna blow our sale. P
I don't... I don't think so.
Uh, for that printer, yes. Unfortunately we don't have a lot of flexibility. D
What if she's just flirting with you to get a better price?
Well, the joke was on you.
'cause I stopped by your desk like 15 times a day.
It is totally insane.
Yeah. That's what we're doing. In our very limited free time and with our very limited budget, we went and got a nanny and then we went out and took a class on a very outmoded and very unnecessary form of communication just so we could talk about you in front of you.
It's a pen.
Michael, no... P
Stanley, please, this is serious!
Exactly. It happened in Big.
So we're gonna say the most likely scenerio is that Michael matured overnight?
Billy Joel Rock Band.
We can order in from Hooters.
Then let's just not do this. Do you have any idea the risks involved?
I'm really too tired to do this.
Now you're just being hurtful.
Yeah, well it's really warm in here. It's like a sleeping bag.
Right? So, uh, let's uh...
Excellent. Go for it. G
Well, it doesn't mean I can't drink it.
What about an energy drink or something?
This is a very good idea. This is good. Let's get all the bad ideas out now. Flush them out.
Okay, just relax. Just need to relax.
Why'd you do that?
What was you? You were the leak?
Guys, I think that seems a little unfair. I mean, I feel like we don't definitely know it was Andy.
Hey, listen man, you can't take it personally.
Hey, Dwight, I don't know if you heard, but we're supposed to be drinking out of weird backpacks instead of cups, like regular people.  Oh, you did hear.
Go get 'em.
Yep. Wait, and this.
I think they run through these panels and then down under the map. I wouldn't know for sure cause I don't have a trained ear. That's why I have to use one of these.
That's right. The janitor said that. By the way, the raccoons are back. D
Well, it would have been. So unprofessional, Mrs. Halpert.
Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I was just gonna put a couple keys on it every day until Christmas. Then his pants would have fallen down, which was a little gift to me, but...
Oh, man, so many points being made.
But you're comparing you and Luke to God and Jesus. M
You really think you can make it up to me with food?
Yep. That's exactly what my first thought was. And then I remembered having a conversation with him where he was like, "I don't own an Ebay store," so...
You follow him on Twitter?
Pretty good. You must be almost out of water.
Oh! Of course there is. Hey, Chinese tonight?
Come on, give me your hand. I'll help you down.
This is impressive.
Is there really?
Were going to head outside, give it a whirl. I just want to see how it works. D
Everything is going to be ok. P
Wait, wait, wait. That's actually a really good idea Kelly.
Ok, Dwight. We can't do that. So why don't you just tell us what happened?
No, no. I want to hear you tell it. D
No, this is instead of the boycott. Yeah?
That's pretty good.
There it is. Alright. D
Lets just go.
Did you just say you remember him?
Stop, stop, stop. S
It's my own fault-
Oh, my God.
Okay, I think everybody just needs to relax.
Alright, well, we're never leaving the house again. P
No, we're good. Thank you, though. E
Well, the car seat was to take her to the hospital, or...
Really, all you had to do was play with her for, like, 30 minutes and then put her to bed. P
Okay, this was pretty simple-
No, it was not a disaster. It was weird, but it wasn't a disaster. I think we have, like, a gift bottle of Irish cream.
That was like, ten years ago.
Am I blocking anybody? Can everybody see?
Nope, it's because it's genitalia.
Just steer more now.
Well, I do the best with what I've got. Let's go.
Amazing. How do I look?
Well, I'm neither of those things, so...
Phoenix Sun's point guard?
I'm not doing that. I'm just explaining.
He's not the Steve Nash. He's big though. He's kind of like...Scranton's Steve Nash.
Oh, ha ha ha. Dwight...
No, he didn't.
So, the situation is the worst.
Well, by worst, you mean the best.
Yeah, I thought you started it.
What? He never called you? I thought you said it just fizzled.
How are ya?
-I'm just gonna watch.
The big gun thing.  Stop!
Listen, you gotta get over here, 'cause we're pitching Steve Nash and Danny Cordray is here.
Hey, it's Jim. Listen, this is important. Are you busy?
Nope, not doing that.
No, that's him.
No, I didn't.
Nope. Different movie.
I think you mean The Sting.
Is that your office?
You know this isn't real TV, right?
Okay. But what is he more famous for?
Meredith Van Helsing?
Okay, he's not that good-looking. I don't understand why everybody's obsessed with this-
We gotta get someone else in there right now.
And listen if anything else happens, just...roll with it.
Stop it! It's gonna be great.
Exactly. You can do this.
So you're taking over. You just gotta get her out of there as soon as you can.
Will you stop? Stop it, stop it. Here's the story-they need Meredith somewhere else asap, okay?
What do you mean?
Who else we got?
Great. Sounds awesome. Just have him pitch to you.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no...
You hired him?
Michael, I think you really want to talk to him.
Hey, crazy, um...so...that's it? You're just-you're fine?
I'm just kidding. She told me about it.
I don't know.  Oh! That's... not... yours.
I am Popeye!
No. No, I'm not gonna-no.
I don't care.
Oooh! You can't handle the truth!
It's not like you guys had some long relationship right? Big painful breakup I don't know about? D
That is crazy. We would never care if Andy or Kevin went to your party.
We have one question to ask the spirit world and you want us to ask that?
Could be. But you also called her the second time so you had the number right.Todd P
Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that everyone has to fall in love, or anything, I'm just saying... but you know, to not even call her back is...
When you work hard, you play hard around here.  Even if you don't work hard. Oh, here's something. Uh, why didn't you ever call Pam back?
Hey. She had a nice time. It seems rude.
Just tell her the real reason.
So by that rationale, if I had to sneeze, I should just sneeze on you.
Ok, your turn.
It is really funny, but you know that can be confusing at a christening because you are not the godfather.
Okay. All right, come on.  Where are we going? Where are we going? We're gonna take a little field trip.
I did... say that.
No. There's no extra outfit in the bag.
This is happening.
Mm. No. Wrong on both counts.
Okay, well, you know what? Everybody's hungry.  Sorry. I think I'm just hungry.
Huh, you think she is jealous about having a baby?
Oh, well, Dave is an adorable baby.
All right. And cider.
I think that was sconesy cider, noted baptism reception critic.
Yeah. Yeah, a little bit. I did.
What's that? Oh, yeah, back then I did. Just now. So, don't, because I've got my eye on you.
All right. Travel safe, Angela.
Uh, everyone? Everyone, can I just have your attention? Has anyone seen a small- Stop that tiny blonde woman! She stole my baby!
A small blonde woman?
I don't know. Hey, have you seen my baby?
I don't know, dad. I don't know.
You can't even do that.
Oh, it was commercial break so I just wanted to check the scores.
What kind of pizza would you like?
I don't think that's gonna...
Well I think enemy's a strong word. 'Cause I think we have a really charming back and forth. And-
I don't know about, love...
I'm not gonna-
I'm going home, and I'm taking my baby with me.
You need to stop talking.
That's not gonna make your pizza eating experience any better. Trust me.
That's--  the password. We're in.
Why don't we just call the I.T. Guy who set it up? What's the name of the guy in Glasses, again?
Okay, I'm not doing every number. P
Uh, it's saying the server went down? Does Anybody know that password? 'Cause otherwise we can't do any work.
Mm-Kay, Well, it can't be zero, Kev. K
Yeah, it's not as fun if I'm not blowing off work.
Talk to me.
'Cause I really think I made good use of my day, oh! Sorry.
Well, A for effort right?
Oh, don't worry about it. Dwight, its okay. You were wrong.
Ahh, Thank you hands. Nothing else in the universe can do what you do.
I disagree with.
Which is you.
Well on the plus side all this worrying about China has made you smarter than Oscar, Michael.
Okay, someone look it up.
Yeah, yeah. Totally.
Oh wow, these are nice.
Oh God, I've been playing Zombie Soccer for two hours?
He's trying to set you up Michael. What's going to happen is he's going to try and bring up what ever you're talking about in a very casual way, but secretly he'll be trying to trip you up, and when he does, boom, its awful. Haven't you noticed that I don't bring up the Tour de France around him?
Woah, woah, woah. Do you know what you just agreed to?
Show him how to use it.
What do you know about boobs? A
Two for two, keep it up.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
And you didn't fail those things either.
But you didn't fail.
What does that mean?
It's still on a bike path though right?
You gotta be kidding me. Who isn't jumping?
One Charlie's Angels. One. Let's go.
Why's it smell real?  Ah... good one.
You got it.
You've got something on your nose.
Well, it's not a snowball, 'cause it's only a dusting. Right?
Me neither. Whew.
We still doing the gifts today?  I mean, it is the Christmas party. Well, the classy Christmas party.
Okay... Holly's back.
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Don't. Stop, Dwight!  Dwight, stop! Dwight, stop!
I can't reconnect with you right now. Hold on one second.
You know what's crazy?
What are you talking about? You're the one terrorizing me.
No, fake girlfriends are always wrong.
Okay, I'm sorry, why are we discounting this whole "Woody came to life" thing so quickly?
You like it?
Ooh, go easy with the shaking.
Well, uh... I don't think any of us really know. Alright.
Right. Of course.  "The Adventures of Jimmy Halpert." Oh, my God. This is awesome! That's my bike. That's my desk. And that is my daughter.
You're a psychopath.
Anything. You got it.
Go! Go! Go!
Okay. This is it.
No, it's, it's okay. Okay.
Have you ever seen 'em do that?
I don't want to go.
Hey! Yeah. No, I got it. Just leaving now.
Oh, come on, that sounds awesome.
I'm just looking for my phone, so... pretend I'm not here.
I just have a meeting, uh, outside the office. D
Was in the green group. P
Pretty good. T
You know what, just think about it, you'll be fine. P
Where'd I put what?
Well, those things that you consider doodles, I consider art. P
Yes, and your mom got a very well deserved day off. So here's the thing though. I left Michael at the gas station on Benet. P
No no no it's ok. So, Cece is with daddy now. She's laughing and she's happy. And we are on our way to see Dr. Barbra. P
Uh, so, Cece had a little bit of a fever. And your mom also locked her in the car. P
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. You're not holding a cup of coffee or anything are you?
Big tip. P
I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I think I was just relieved, to see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back.
Four hundred and ninety-FIVE months. That's just...
Four hundred and ninety-four months?
Okay now really think hard about this o
Because of the sign, that says no pounding no begging.
You did approve it?
Why is Packer back?
Nice. You know, I cleaned our daughter for like, an hour at four a.m. this morning, so...
Can I do something for ya?
Do I have any say in this?!
Well, I mean he humped Michael.
Why are you nodding?
Whoa, pull it back. Uhm, why did you hire Todd Packer? H
Can I talk to you a second?
That's a lot of reasons!
Absolutely, I'll e-mail you a hundred.
He... It's a crime fighting beaver.
Okay! Well this isn't my best, but call Froggy101, say that we're the tour manager for Justin Bieber, and we're giving away free tickets, we give him a number to call for the tickets, and it's his own number.
You've gotta stop with the hot chocolate stuff. I was thinking we can jam his drawers, so they only comes out two inches, then he can see everything in them but he can't get to them.
Here we go.
What do we think, what would drive him crazy.
I really think we should join forces on this one.  D
Well, you know you can't actually poison him. D
One thirty-five. Did you like one thirty-five?
Yeah I couldn't cut it down.
Whatever you wanna do in your spare time is up to you!
It is weird! Look at you, perceptive. Now I know why Jo's kept her eye on you!
Wait! Why don't we come up with a plan we're all happy about?
He's a jerk.
Correction. I do not want to sell you Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes.
Probably, probably. So I buy some, I turn the corner, I feel like an idiot, so I go back to get my money, he was gone.
I was in Jamaica, and I got lost, and it was getting dark this one night and then out of nowhere with a cart and he's selling these. Dwight he's telling me things about myself that there's no way he could have known.
How did those get out? I'm sorry.
They're legumes Dwight, and you're just gonna make fun of me, so why would I... You know what, this ends now.
I'm really sorry. Pam must have put those out.
She's amazing. This is very exciting.
Yeah... it.s scary.
Cause it's a big deal. I mean.. I knew Pam was gonna say yes but I was still scared.
Totally reasonable. M
At a gas station.
Don't think you need the corpse then.
That's a guarantee.
Leave the telescope.
They're probably worthless.
It is right. I mean, it's impossible.
Oh my God.
Not bad right.
Holly, will you marry me?
We made that.
Yeah, they don't ever talk about careers that were made because of unplanned pregnancies.
We were... I think she was just trying to-
And what happens here is-
Alright, wait, little bit of backstory, she loves dogs. She calls them 'da-das'.
Wait, so, you don't go into shock or die or anything?
Thank you very much.
We're back in! Right?
Stay in bed!
No she doesn't wa- She's not here.
Why don't you just, privately, in your own head, think of it like a meeting.
Having a great time.
I think you got this. Kay?  Alright. Feel better!
I think I'm gonna go.
Get in the car?
Who's gonna see us?
I gotta go do this.
I don't know maybe being a good dad is just all in your own compass. I don't know, I don't know. Thank you!
Wow! I do not parent for the award but I gotta tell you It feels pretty good. Uh, Cece, if you're watching this at home it's way past your bedtime, by the way how'd this get televised?
Nope, go back to the script.
That did. Pretty huge laugh.
I don't know that we need to dissect it all now, but-
You gotta play along man.
Did you break the shredder Kevin?
Hey! It's almost your last day, come sit with us.
Uhh, she's still pricing the whatevers. The shredders.
You got it.
I will see you, tomorrow at lunch.
Listen Michael, I really... I did text Pam, but...
And then tomorrow, I can tell you... what a great boss, you turned out to be. The best boss I ever had.
You know what I think we should do? I think we should just save the goodbyes for tomorrow. At lunch.
Absolutely not. It's just that sometimes... goodbyes are a bitch.
Wow, so that's it huh? Just, four o'clock and you are gone for good.
You're not leaving tomorrow. You're leaving today right?
What do you think? Tomorrow? Lunch, you and me?
So I've been meaning to tell ya, I wanna take you out for lunch. For your last day.
Careful.  There is no inner circle.
Every time there's a silence, your brain's like "Heh-heh-huh-huh" .
No he doesn't.  You just get so nervous and hyper around him.
And say what?  "Hey Deangelo, are you shy or just a sexist?"
He's good at his job.  And I like working for him.
What could he possibly stand to gain from a fake juggling routine?
It was --
Oh.  Like nobody.
Whoa.  Whoa.  Wait.
Maybe there's a vibe out there, with certain members of the office, that you are...a little sexist, or --
I know.   Just the guys.  Well, maybe that's, uh, part of the problem.  I think...so what happened was, I was talking with some of the department heads.  Uh, some of the female department heads.
If it's alright, can I just have like one minute alone, just to go over --
Umm, really, it's nothing, I was just talking to Angela, and she was --
Hey, who'd you end up hiring?
He didn't text me.
Oh yeah, did he text us?
Don't worry, the first day's always the hardest.
Well, there is no inner...circle.
Today.  Now, maybe.  'Cause we have a hoop downstairs and a real ball, so you don't have to mime it.
You know what?  Instead of a game, why don't we do an exhibition?  I'd love to see that dunk of yours.
15 feet from the baseline, so, you need me to move it in?
Nope. Baskets have it.
All in favor of the baskets full of chocolates, teddy bears, and balloons?
You'd slow me down.
You define foment.
Question, if we already fomented insurrection, may we be grandfathered in?
Nope. Social club. God, I hate when everybody calls us a rebellion.
Oh, it's just a social club. You know, like the French Revolution, or the Black Panthers, or communism. It's just a club. Guys talking, you know. D
You wouldn't dare. D
You can't fire me. You're acting manager. Not office manager. So you have no firing powers. D
I promise...d other people that I would be on my worst behavior. And I gave them my word, so...
Nope. When Jo's here, can you work in "Shagadelic, baby," at least three times in a conversation? Oh, and when I cough can you do jazz hands?
Oh, is it my turn? Ooh, I'm on the spot. I don't know. Um... you know what? I think I'm good.
Well, I don't know about that. Just wasn't for me. But let me assure you, Dwight is firing on all cylinders. Right?
Well, you do know that Jo was right to take the job away from you, right? There's no debating that. But, I will say... in your one week, every single one of the orders went out on time. And I think that is shagadelic, baby.
Did you just trademark that...
How about this. Why don't you give us a part of the plan, and that way we know you have it.
You could just be saying it to get the job.
...What is it?
Heh. We think that 25 cents a mile is pretty generous.
Unfortunately, that range is set at corporate.
Can you...  You are a man of great confidence. Could you speak a little more to that, and, what the role of confidence... would be... in a dialogue with a subordinate?
Yeah, it's no big deal, just something that looks like that.
So I think all we need is a resume, and we'll be good right?
Well, for instance, how did you deal with it when two warehouse guys got into a fight?
Is this a bad time to be doing this?
Can I ask why you're leaving your current job?
Your department's just you, right?
Unfortunately, Jo also took the job away from you because she doesn't trust your judgment. So how would that look for me, if I recommended you?
Well, you know how I like taking bribes.
Okay. That's vivid.
You're not getting an interview, Dwight. The whole point of this Search Committee process is to prevent hiring someone like you ever again.
Darryl! We all know you. Your interview is not nearly as important as the other guys.
He's an amazing man. He's a Rhodes Scholar. He invented an app that invents apps. Fantastic kisser...
Oh... Deshaun Williams.
I'm sure it's fine.
I think that's probably all we need to hear from...
That's very interesting. Um, I feel like there might be a conflict there, and if a conflict did arise, how would that be dealt with?
Okay, everybody, I was just making a joke. I am taking it seriously, I promise.
No, not at all. In fact, I'm not even taking it seriously. I think at the end of the day, I'm just gonna pick a name out of the hat.
You know what? They all just sort of blend together after a while.
No, was it good?
Oh, that's my mistake, sorry about that. The last paper company you worked for burned to the ground? And all because they wouldn't hire a manager who lived and breathed paper? That's a travesty.
What is it?
Assistant to the Regional Manager.
So you worked at your last job for 15 years as Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Um... why Kelly?
Finger Lakes guy is good. Darryl is also very good.
You know, she also gave me a reason to think that maybe she wasn't a good fit.
Oh, I didn't know you knew her?
What is happening right now?
That's not okay.
You took the deal.
He's not a real candidate.
Well, that was quick.
Thank you, Dwight.
All right, guys, good day, a lot of candidates. Let's discuss.
I just did. The answer to that one question told me everything I need to know.
Thank you, Mr. Schnoot.  We will let you know.
Perfect. There are several outside candidates that we think would be really-
I suppose I am.
Okay, seems like everybody has an opinion. So, who else? Anybody?
Am I the only one who remembers what he did when he was in charge? I feel like I'm going a little bit crazy.
No, no, no. Not ever, 'cause that's not gonna happen.
Okay.  Okay, guys, just so you all know, no decision has been made, and Dwight is definitely not the boss.
No, why would you think that?
Hey! Hey! Hey!
No, they can't. That's not how this is gonna work.
I don't know. This conversation really got away from me.
What? No, no, it's not a vote.
No, I told you I dont like that joke. It is a boy. We found out early.
Hes got a bank vault. Thats a start.
What is this?
Why are you- How do you know?
I promise you, we dont need a warning-
We dont need a warning signal, Kevin. We can see him right there-
No. Okay. Um, Ill take a photo of it. Dwight, can you throw me my phone?
Okay, just wait one second, alright? I will copy it. Do you have a pen?
 Its just a list of our names, split into two columns.
Its, its nothing.
Okay, its not that Pam. You know, I was thinking it reminds me of those lists Dwight used to make.
Uh, no, actually. That was in Roberts notebook.
I dont think its-
Okay. See you guys.
Nope. No dog video.
Hey. Its nothing. Alright? Ill text you when we get there. Let you know whats going on.
Alright, well, I will see you in a bit.
Wait, wait, wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Will you stop?!
Mmum, still wrong.
Thats not it.
Yeah, she does like Elmo.
Oh, I didnt know anybody called it- She likes it a lot- she, uh, loves Elmo.
Uhhh, the street?
Ryan? A little help?
Good. What? Nothin'
I don't think we have to do this again cause it's gonna take a whole.
Come on, man.
Yeah, alright Kev why dont you come with us?
No, see? Right there, thats the problem with your method. Cause I still dont know if youre saying Sea World or see the world, and its taking a lot of time to explain it.
K, Kevin, are you saying See the world? or Sea World?
Does it save time though? Cause weve been here for about an hour.
Ill take five.
How many L to a K?
Wow. Alright. Cant wait to meet her.
New leads, a new territory to look into, maybe an in with a big company that we could get our foot in the door
He brings up two good points.  Do you have any new leads? Any new territories you want us to look into? Maybe have an in with a big client that we can get our foot in the door?
Why dont you start?
You have a walking buddy.
We know that.
She looks at it when shes on the potty, and she makes the faces.
Wait. You did say we could pool our points, right? In that caselets get to work.
Alright, alright. And you are totally serious?
Thats pretty good.  What about uh, for a thousand points?
I dont know, for such a crazy number Id like something pretty crazy.
But, what if?
What if we went all the way up to five hundred points?
and Im back. How are you sir?....I think we can squeeze a couple more golf games in, right?
Yeah. Big sale. Dont worry about it though, I dont really care about the points.  I would like a point receipt though
Nah, you definitely werent kidding.  And that came across loud and clear. Oh, by the way, I want to hand this in.
Oh, one hundred percent.  We all want to see you tattoo your ass.
I dont know what to tell you, man.
No, I didnt notice anything.
But I think its big enough to buy you some time till your next great idea.which, by the way, I cant wait for.
Andy, nobody really expects you to go through with this
Pull up your pants.
Nope, he means tuna dog.
I'd hang on to it though, cause I can think of a bunch. Like a 70's theme party, or a 70's theme meeting, or a 70's theme convention...
Yeah, that's pretty good.
Oscar, what do you wanna do, this is kinda your deal. You wanna dog?
What if he jumps out the window and runs away?
So...ah, who's gonna take the dog?
Alright! Nice job, Oscar!
Whoa whoa whoa whoa!
Dwight! At least aim it.
Do Snowboarders hate animals?
Oh man, it's gotta be over a hundred thousand dollars.
I don't know about Stephen King, I mean...
Stop. I'm a barista in your fantasy?
Which ideally would be me....
Whoa. Saucy. I thought you liked Maine?
No, I'd probably buy a big piece of land in Maine, build a house, work in town. Somewhere I could bike to or kayak to. I'd either bike to my job at the kayak shop or kayak to my job at the bike shop.
I mean, I don't even know what I'd do with all that money.
Uh, yeah. I mean, as the strongest person in this office, I guess I should go down with you...
Nice.  Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Oh!
It's a great idea Kev, I don't think it applies here though, so maybe we just-
Not that, don't...
I'd go with that.
Yeah  Not that they're not smart people.
There's gotta be a better way to do this. This is literally how they built the pyramids.
A...hot chocolate tea
Nope. You're, you're doing a great job of it in my fantasy right now.
It is, yeah. I mean I just don't know why I'm compromising if it's my fantasy. Cause in my fantasy it's Maine and you love it.
Our fake w
Is he OK?
So sadly, it's the best idea on the table.
But, the fact remains we gotta move these boxes.
Porque es muy rapido.
That's OK, we're good.
Doesn't matter what the name is. Seor Loadenstein, that's stupid.
OK, alright, that's...look. All we were trying to do is we thought we could come up with a more efficient way to do things.
But what are you gonna do about that?
Just like now....too bad the schools are terrible.
And I can fish right from the window of Pam's pottery studio. And we can chat any time we want.
Right. It's city and country combined.
Ok, Dwight! Come on. Here, I think I have an idea.
Ok, I just asked that ques-, I don't know. I mean it seems like the door is huge, right? So you should be able to back the truck up to the paper.
No! Stop! Stop stop stop stop! You're way over! Ok, you gotta cut it! Cut it hard! (bleep!) Stop stop stop stop! Stop, stop! Dammit Dwight. Great. D
Whoa whoa whoa!
You've seen it, right?
Okay, don't be gross.
Ah, and did Robert California get an invite to your party?
Ah. Why do you keep reading that garden party book? I mean, how hard are finger sandwiches and tea?
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Oh, hey, how are you doing, I'm Jim.Walter J
I'm so sorry, I think I forgot that thing...
I didn't forget them, they're right here.
I don't know if I can.
Yeah, I had just told you about the day that I met the Blue Angels. I figured you had to top it.
Mmhmm. No, but what I'm saying is, like, do you ever wonder what it was?
Was it, like, trickery in the lights, or maybe you were so primed to see it, then there it was?
I aint fraid of no ghost.  Whoa!
It didnt have a buster sign around him?  Why dont you draw him?  Why dont we see this whole thing.
Its called Ghostbusters.
Hey its Jim Halpert.  I was wondering if you wanted to see a movie tonight.  Because Ive read a lot about this really great documentary.
I was talking about my wife and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate and Meredith said she believes in them too.
Thats funny.  Ok.
Are you serious?
No. That is just a bunch of people participating in a collective thing that maybe the Eagles will hear about and want to play better. It's not...
Careful, whoa. First of all, it's not like I think that's going to help the Eagles win. P
Oh, come on! R
I was talking about my wife, and how she believes in ghosts. And then we had a little debate. Meredith said she believes in them too.
Pink is the red-
But that would make more sense.
Oscar, how are you on that side?
Uh no it's W R K, as in kitten.  Oh my boss is singing Closing Time, maybe that's what you are hearing.
Is that off again?
Which when it goes off it destroys everything. Very similar to a doomsday device.
Wait, so you installed a doomsday device?
If this bad idea goes off and we all lose our jobs. Are you going to feel good about that?
If this doomsday device goes off...
I'll try both.
Ok, where is he?
Exactly. Here we go. Let's do it.
You up for a game?
Yeah, well, you know just had a meeting. Squash meeting.
In the box.
Ha ha. No, I don't. No, I don't. Alright, well, I am sore and obviously horrible at this, so-
Oh yeah. I have the one that nobody has. Is there anything interesting?
What kinda iPhone is that?
Awww, sorry. Did it break?
Here you go.
Yes. Right now? Yes.
Oh, oh yeah.
Nah, I think it's mine. Lemme just check real quick, here. Alright.
Yeah. That does not feel good.
Yep. Ah. Oh.
Ok, this is crazy.
No- Ok. Well, we'll talk about it later. Straussburg! I had a meeting in Straussburg and I dropped you off beforehand. I was wearing a tan shirt with stripes?
I wasn't here that day.
Ok, he didn't fix it. The brightness level was all the way down.
Well, that is... because you didn't realize that... I was left-handed.
No? Come on.
Good game. You are a worthy opponent. You wanna play one more?
Honestly I have no idea. I just figured wed save her from Ryan right?
Hmm. Doubt it.
No, I don't.
And I'm telling you, I don't.
Yeah. Super pretty.
Okay. Uh, I don't. So are we good?
Not his mom's car.
Oh, you know who might be good? Mike Tibbets.
Oh, I stand corrected.
Sorry about that.
Okay, what can I do to make you believe me?
Oh, you know what? This reminds me, Cece needs a new toothbrush.
Okay, Dwight, come on.  You can go first.Old M
Stop shoving me.
Okay, easy. Trust me, I'm around for the long-haul.
I don't know.
Yeah, but I don't smoke.
Pam, are you really gonna listen to his stupid homemade test?
I am not lying.
Oh okay, she's going into labor. Make way, everybody!
How do you feel?
Okay guys, here we go! We'll see you!
Oh my God!
No, of course we're not tourists. We're just people that aren't from here who are taking a tour.
Visitor center. Gonna grab a map for the memorials, right?
Only two hundred dollars?
Yeah, that's what I had for breakfast and I think that's probably why I'm still hungry.
Oh wow.  So thats two miles if you incorporate the walk back.
Andy  this whole idea of our situation being just like war?  Its just not true.  We just work at a paper company.  And youre our regional manager.  And guess what man?  You dont have to prove anything.  We like you as regional manager.  Andy if you dont believe me take a look at whats on my head.  Im wearing a very pink hat.  Ive been getting weird looks all day because Im pretty sure DM does GB means something kinda sexual.  But guess whos wearing them?  All of us.  Just for you man.  Thats huge.
What are you talking about?
Yeah sorry everyone else didnt come.  I think theyre just tired.  With holes in their shoes.  And they have dysentery.  A
Oh-ho, I am in.
And to drink?
Where do all the cool kids go when they come to this consecrated ground?
Ok, you know what? Andy probably has the number for this guy. I'm gonna find him.
That's weird, if it's not locked, why isn't it opening?
We didn't have one scheduled.
Hey guys lets just all admit it. Ok? Dwights better than us. He had the guts to stop sitting. And hes never, ever going to go back on it right?
You know I have to do this.
Because youre sitting?
Because youre sitting?
You know what its not my best. Because you could just easily bend over and pick it up right?
I dont know. He wasnt talking to me. But if I were you I wouldnt hire his wife.
I think you could just do Andy Bernard.
Well its not that easy. Its kind of sometimes difficult.
Well its sales. So you have to be able to live in the world of rejection.
Oh, wow. So cute.
Yes. All right. Great.
I don't know what you want me to tell you. To be really honest, my wife works here. And I love it. She literally makes me work harder. She makes me smarter. She makes me remember why I'm here. And between us, she's on maternity leave right now, and I would love to leave this room and see her face. I would love it. I don't know how this helps, but it's just what I'm thinking.
That's the thing. See, I didn't want to get in the middle of this. Still don't. But here's s
I really wish I could help. I'm not really sure how I can...
I know, I do.
You absolutely should. He said it was ok, so till you get him, I'll just be in, you know. Bob's S
She's not your grandmother, is she?
Can't do that.
What was that?
Pam never seemed to have a problem with us.
Ow, What are you doing?
Kathy wants to leave our clump?
It wasn't me.
I wonder, in this office, who has access to a porcupine?
And what's it's name?
Uh, were you quilled?
Yes, I'm calling from Dunder Mifflin. We have a very rabid porcupine in our office, someone should come pick it up.
OK, you know what? Why don't we just call animal control...
Andy, you've gotta be kidding me.
Nice try, this is ridiculous.
I'll figure it out, get to the bottom of it....Merry merry.
Right. You're right. So maybe it was me who did it...by accident.
Let me just see that one more time. Yep, you know what? I know who my friends are, now. But I shouldn't have got you involved because the truth is, I don't even really care about this picture, its a little out of focus. It was probably an accident, right? Like...
I know, I mean the way I see it is you can deface any picture of me, any one, pick one. Not my kid though.
Yes. It is.
Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, I uh, just found this on my desk.  Need to talk to somebody about it. Can you believe that?
Yes. They totally do.
You know what? You're sitting, and thinking, and it's probably better if it comes from me anyway.
Alright. I will definitely do that.
Two friends who are not sleeping together, can they remain friends? Yes, yeah.
Cathy wants to leave our clump?
Sorry it didn't work out. Hope you find what you're looking for.
That'd be great, thank you.
All right, here we go! Everybody get read in three, two, good luck, one-
All right, not bad at all. I think we can beat 20 minutes though so let's try again. Get it all out now if you have to.
Very nice. Very nice sales pitch for our clients that don't know what paper is.
You can write a book about chairs.
All right, good stuff.
That's a great idea.
Stop right there. I love it.
There's a table over here.
I thought it was a fun idea.
Oh my God. Lamar Odom, yes.
Wrong, for so many reasons.
Andy, it's the last day of the quarter. We've already called all our clients, so making that much in a day is going to be tough.
Andy, we're gonna do our best. But you know what? At the end of the day seven point...whatever percent is pretty good.
I guess I thought you were approaching it with more of a sarcasm than misery. Kind of laughing at your own pain, sad clown thing.
I'm sorry, I thought you were making a joke.
You know, there's a glare from over here... oh wow, that's magnificent.
DJ Pam Halpert is spinning some serious Radio Disney tonight.
Hey. Wow. Just stopping by. Got another party to go to. A wife and two kids at home party.
I bet I should.  That's beautiful, I'm going to email that to you.
Robert, thank you. Thank you for this. Thank you for all this. This night's been magical.
To both these bears.
And there's my talking point.
Are you serious?
Hey, um, I think you parked my car in. Is there any way you can move your van?
To the shame room!
We're best friends, actually. We're going wine-tasting next weekend, if you want to come.
Nope. Not guilty.
Uh, hit and run.
It was pretty uneventful, actually.
Aw man, I would but I can't miss any more work.
Wow, I'm really sorry.
Mine was actually a pretty boring case, so-
Oh man, Ernesto's. That was our favorite restaurant too.
No. I never said he was on a bicycle. I just said I wasn't listening to you.
Okay, wait, wait.
Are you sure you can keep this under wraps?
Okay. I think the best thing to do right now is just come clean and tell everybody the truth.
Because my car broke down.
Uh, you guys are going to love these. So, empanadas on me. You guys gotta try them.
The empanada guy!
Okay, listen, all right? Dwight's on to us, he's going to figure it out really soon, so let's just get ahead of it, let's tell the truth.
Well, I think you handled it pretty well.
Pam really needed some help with the kids, so, I promise my intentions were good.
Funny? No? Nobody laughing?
Okay, let's go.
Split the difference?
Whoa, no, no. That's overdoing it, I think.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, game face, baby, game face.
All right, I know, I know. Let's just get this.
All right, all right. Okay.
I don't know what else we can do here.
You know what? I don't think you need to do things on command. That's very weird. I'll just take that. Thank you. I think we should just wrap up the show, kiddos. Right?
Oh, Aunt Phyllis.
Oh my goodness, let's take a look at these. They're usually amazing, so let's see. Yup, they are. Uncle Andy.
That was a great idea.
Did you say something about this one bringing in something for these people?
Wow, what a surprise. That's crazy. You guys get to meet the little heck-raisers.
No, no, it's okay, I'll be right back.
Hi, all right. I'm just going to go down to the car and I'm going to put her in her seat and I'll be right back up.
I'm gonna grab her, okay.
I know, I know.
Okay, okay, we gotta go. All right, we're going home, we're going home. We're going home, we're going home. I know, I know, bud.
Oh bud, I know. Do you have a pacifier or anything?
Thanks guys. All right, here we go. Let's go.
I'm not gonna eat it.
And shove it up my butt.
Ok, ok, ok.
It's not really food, right?
Uh, I can't get a handle on it. Am I cheap or rich? I can't...
Ok. Well, hey, you're not here. You don't know, Ok? It's intense. They made me eat black licorice.
I feel like a stranger in my own country.
It's a lunch thing.
No, it's bad. Darryl canceled go-karting....
Nope. It's over.
Ooh, me three.
I hope not.  Because I am not going. Two question marks?
Duh- Wait. I just feel weird. I should just call him.
Yeah, it's a golf text.
Got your text, awesome idea. Let's hit the links next time you're in PA Dash JH.
Robert, Hey! Exclamation point.
Really did  He responded L-O-L.
Robert, great offer. Wish I could hit the links with you in Florida but a father of a newborn really should be helping out his wife any chance he gets.
Yeah, that's what I'm saying. They're incredibly helpful, you're lucky to have them. I mean with them there, you probably won't even know I'm gone.
I think you're right.
Hey, quick q
Well, I got a text from RC inviting me to come down so I think that's gonna make us roomates.
Alright, I'm gonna pack my trunks.
Hold on, just wanna get it on camera.
You know Dwight, if you didn't want me to go the smart move would be to tell Andy that I actually am essential to the operation. That way I couldn't go.
Is that the buzzer from Taboo?
Dwight, is now a good time to go over what you expect of us?
That sounds awesome.
So, what is this special project?
Yeah. It's weird being away from them. Never done this before.
Loggins and Messina.
That's a good one.  Whoa, Stanley! Did you just come back from burning down a rival nightclub?
Oh no, I'm serious. I was thinking, "For this trip I have to do something epic, so what should that be?" and then I thought of it. I'll poison you. What are you gonna do? You gonna steal my newspaper or put a cricket in my cereal or something?
Are you sure it's stress? Because I did poison you.
I would love to hear the other mottos.
Fantastic. Stanley drives so fast.
True love's kiss.
You got to stop with the antacids. It's not the antidote.
Dwight, I didn't poison you. I was kidding.
Ah, let's do it.  Oh, that's healthy.
Is that another motto?
No one's moving!
Dwight, why don't we just hold off with the human pyramids for a while?
All right, what the heck? Let's do it.
Oh, I don't know.
Wha- no. No, it was not a poisoning.
Dwight, will you go back to the hospital? You were there for like three hours.
Stanley, are you listening to music?
You haven't done any of the research.
You are bleeding through your shirt.
'Talla-nasty', very clever.
College rules (Cathy throws Jim the bag and Jim kicks Dwight)
How many buttons do you have?
Alright, that's gonna do it for me tonight. Have a lovely evening.
Yes, nice. Good word a
Oh, no, that's not this 'cause that's in March. Uh, this is just the NBA. Professional. Miami Heat, actually, so
Uh yeah, I'm just watching basketball.
Hey, how's it going?
Stanley. Uhh you know what? Just bring back those bottles!
No, no, no, Stanley.
Do you want to watch the game with us? We're watching a game. The Heat game. Just a game.
We have plenty.
Yup, coming.  All right.
I'm sorry, I thought you'd want to know that I saw a bedbug in my room. But, never mind, sorry to interrupt.
Alright, then I will catch you later What do we do now?
He knows what he's doing.
Just check it.
I know. D
So smug. Like he thought it was funny, like this.
Stressed, but to be fair, it was a tense situation.
Brown, shiny, painful bite.
In the bed.
Okay, Dwight Dwight Dwight, Dwight Dwight! uh
Is that really how you want to get this job?
Okay, they're fine. They're adults.
You know what? Maybe they just ate.
Well, maybe it isn't warm enough in here.
I don't know, Dwight, I think maybe you should check again.
Yes, I can.  uh, all right. I'm really sorry. I think we'll just we'll just watch. You can watch, not watch, whatever you want to do. Take another shower, I don't care.
I'm sorry, I feel like maybe I'm-I'm I misread things. Okay, let's just go back to watching.
um I mean-
Okay alright.  I'm really sorry, uh, I just have to say it. I'm-I'm married. I'm very happily married.
Nice job, I think you got 'em.
Oh, big one! Big one! Really big one!
All right. Now I think it's time for you to go.
Is that Nellie?
Oh yeah? What's the first best?
Come on, man.
Which Spice Girl?
Uh, I - I gotta go. Okay.
Yeah, no, it seems to be going great. Andy got beat up by a fifth grade girl?
Im really sorry. Is there anything I can do, maybe pretend to be Chuck?
Im very sorry.
I thought it was great, sweetie. I would just fix that one --
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I think ...it seemed like you were a little nervous.
Im not doing the Presentation.
Its Ryan. Im sorry. I lied. Im not in the bathroom. I cant do it. I need to see my mom. Im going home.
Oops, thats my phone. Am I allowed to answer it or are you gonna freak out?
About ten minutes.
Ive been in here for 20 seconds.
Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
All right. Thank you so much. Wow. Wow! And good night!
When I was ten years old, my parents took me to Disney world. I cried the whole time. I was not able to comprehend the beauty that was before me. I just wanted... to go home. This is what the Pyramid will do for you. It is the bridge to the world. It has a usb port. Wireless... will be available in 2013. You can play Anything from Chuck to Cars 2. With the Pyramid, you have the connection to everything -- in time... and space. C
This... is the future, because... This is the past. Ive been through a lot of issues in my life. Ive seen drug addiction -- unemployment. Ive been in a relationship that tore my heart apart, without ever being able to accept that love drove the pain.
Time. Space. Gender.  No, thats -- D
Oh, that reminds me.
All right. So... I guess this is it.
Wow. When you put it that way, I guess it does sound pretty terrible.Robert C
Thank you.Robert C
I thought you liked the store?Robert C
What's that?Robert C
You know, I just think you should know that-
Um, actually it's, it's for your own good. I think maybe we should-
Can I just talk to you for one quick second?
OK. All right.
Stanley's very upset that we're leaving Florida. But he would back me up.
Yes... my pretty hardest. Look, you haven't dealt with him in awhile, all right. He's like super Dwight. It's like he's been bitten by a radioactive Dwight, or som- Stanley, back me up.
I tried. He will not listen.
No, no, I think it was more like, 'you know, I liked him, but I don't anymore because he did a bad job, so I'm definitely gonna yell at him'.
Dwight, come o-
OK, first of all, they've mostly worked, so-
And then, I'm pretty sure he's gonna fire you for it. D
Dwight, he's gonna kill the store.
Listen to me. Robert is going to veto the Sabre store. D
OK, great, listen to me. Listen to me.  No, no, I know. Will you just let me tell you one thing, please? D
You all right? You ok?
What? What, what, what, what, what?
OK.  What are you doing? Are you really revving up? you know that doesn't work.
Get up. All right? I'm not gonna let you by.
What are you doing?
Nope. I think that was it.
This is dangerous.
I missed you.
Yeah, the crazy thing about that is, um, wow you look great. Did you lose some weight?
And I was still just a paper salesman.
What brings you to town?
No, that's Andy's office.
Can't you do something about this?
Like, set up camp in your office and is calling herself the manager.
What? You're in Florida? Andy, Nellie Bertram's trying to take your job.
Andy, where are you?
Dwight, should she be our manager?
The raise isn't real.
No. I would've said no.
Was that it? No, that wasn't bad.
Was that not the--
Oh, god, nature, please.
Land. World. Uh, it's not that I don't want a-- well, yes, I guess I'd take a raise. That's not what I'm saying. That's not-- sorry.
Yeah. She gave one to Dwight, Phyllis.
All right, guys, stop.
Let's see it. Show of hands.
Yeah, that's the thing. I don't know if you can even give raises.
No, it's not, because you don't really work here.
Who says no moustache?
Okay, quick. Who says moustache?
Okay, the man's worked here for 25 years. How can none of us picture his face?
Stanley doesn't have a moustache.
Oh, great.  "Glad they didn't mix up your tonsillectomy with a moustachectomy." Oh that's not good.
Oh! Hire a magician.
Sounds like every other party.
That's moving boxes. We just came up with the term to make it sound cooler.
Ah, nothing, just hauling some cube with Dwight.
Excuse me, one second. Hi.
That was one time-
Nellie, that reminds me. Do you want this chair in the bedroom? 'Cause to be honest, I don't think it's gonna fit through the door.
Oh, Nellie. I'm so sorry. We were just...
Better theory. This is her ex-boyfriend and they went through some kind of painful breakup.
Yeah. Whoa. Here's one with his face whited out.
Like a boyfriend?
Whoa. Who is this guy?
I doubt that they're sh-
"Nellie, don't open, stupid. Love, Nellie."
Yes, you should.
No, no. Of course. Just one quick question. Was this um, Halloween, or...
I'm so sorry. These must be very painful memories.
Absolutely. Yeah.  Call it off, Pam. Call it off, okay? It's way more complicated than you think. Cancel the magician. Trust me.
No, that's not what I-
Oh. Well. I feel that as someone who knows Pam only a little bit... enough. A good amount. Not the most, though. I would say that she is misunderstood and that maybe there's some stuff in her past that you guys don't know about that's a little messed up and probably makes her such a torture to work with.
Not true. 'Cause that's not a real place.
It's the four of hearts.
I'll do it.
Oh, I'll do it. I will volunteer.
Well, turns out he actually made it up there.
And that's noon. Exactly.
Hey, come on.
Yep. Because Kelly is Indian and... oh, that's it.
Sorry, just to be clear, you're saying do NOT shake the baby.
That's about it, yeah.
I was very drunk.
Um... I don't... Uh, yes, that time that it was very late. Uh, we'd had sex so many times already, I was exhausted...
Couple of times.
Wow, what are we talking about?
Well, it's good to see Kelly's maturing.
Hey, hey. Okay.
Not at all, can we go?
Okay, you could just show up late though.
Tickets are 250 bucks.
Wow! Look at that! It says he's actually playing State College. That's only three hours away!
Well, I second that emotion.
Wow That's terrible, I really liked him.
Wow, that's exciting! But until you firm up the idea, you might want to keep it between us.
Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to him and I guarantee you he gives out his cell phone to everybody.
What happened, did he do it?
Okay, what was this look?
Okay, Oscar, I'm not saying you're not dreamy, because you are, but isn't it possible that he was just schmoosing a voter? O
Wait, what? Come on!
Oh, hey! you bought me those shoes!
what is interesting? I just proved that he gives his cell out to everybody.
Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech!
Yeah! Like that rock opera! You could always do that right?
Okay well, Andy, listen. It's okay if you don't feel totally settled. This is all very fresh.
Look at that one though, he's smiling!
Hey, just wanted to check in. See how you are doing.
Listen, guys, I think we all want to know the same thing, right? Whos the strongest? Well, theres only one way to solve that  flat curl contest.
Quick phone call from you guys, keep going,
Here, this is for your elbows, for your elbows.
Come on, Gabe, you cant handle his hamstrings. Youre getting hypno-thigh-zed.
Okay. You dont need my help?
Sorry, man, I cant focus on zingers. Theres too many potential clients.
In the fridge.
Hey, hey, come on, language.
Binghamton branch closed last night and their clients are up for grabs.
Wow, simultaneous sale.
Pam made a drawing of Lloyd. He is a blend of all the salesman.
Okay, it sounds sketchy, but it helps us get more money.
How about this? How about we just ask Robert? Can we all agree that maybe the C.E.O should decide this?
Theres actually not a rule that says that.
1. Here we go!
Brace yourself. 3 2
Are you sure?
Oh, yeah, definitely have nos.
Nos? You mean like in fast and furious?
What? What am I gonna do? I dont 
Is that him?
Hold on, hold on. Is this him?
Its a monkey.
I dont even know where the stairs are!
What are you talking about?
Dwight, what are you doing?
You all right?
Big Red Paper Company?Mr. R
But youre saying theres a chance.
All right, guys. It didnt work out for any of us, so were still on the same team. Let me get these.
That sounds lovely.
I dont know. Ive always wanted to own a bike shop, but what about you?
Yeah! I know it sounds stupid, but nationals has always kinda been a dream of mine.
Oh, man, Id have to sell beets. Probably submit them for competitions.
I know why you're doing this, Dwight.
Great, yeah, good.
How's it going, man?
Is a mop the most efficient tool to use on a carpet?
But are you a hundred percent sure? I don't think any of us are.
No, we decided it was crazy not to worry about it.
No, we talked about not bringing them in to Dwight's photo studio slash trap.
Oh, so that's it?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let's do it, shoot it.
Yeah, just keep your eye on Dwight, great.
Just do it.
This is great.
-give him to me and... perfect.
Alright. Why don't you just-
Yeah. You just sit right here. Here we go.
Andy, come on.
No, no, see? This is what we're talking about. I mean, what was that accent? And last time I checked, you were drunk and now you're not drunk...
Perhaps your year of experience managing this branch will come in handy.
An Altima or better.
In Philly, so, that doesnt really work for the family. Watch this guy make a billion dollars off my idea.
Its sports marketing basically. But the athletes are partners.
You are really good at modesty. Shes a genius.  She painted this incredible mural in the kids room. Theres a hippo leading a parade of 500 children
You should ask him. Its a color you would never expect.  Too easy.
Clark ended the whole thing with a karate demonstration. Did you know there was a belt above black?
The new guys called one.
Ok. Good talk.
No, like baseball. A baseball team.
Phillies fan, though, right?
Oh. Any team sports?
Yeah. You know what? Ill meet you down there. Just gotta make a quick call.
Spinning would be more fun.
Just so weird.
Oh, come on. Not even Roy will have hot dogs at his wedding.
Uh, my ex-fianc.
Yeah, you never know.
Not gravel, obviously.  No, things are good. Things are good. Got some stuff in the works. So-
By the way, man, this place is... beautiful.
That was, that was a surprise.
Thanks for inviting us, by the way-
He plays piano?
It was an away game.
Courtside seats. Sixers.
You all right?
That's all right.
That I thought we were millionaires.
You heard that one.
I'm sorry. This is for a news audition?
God, give it up, Beesley. You know me too well.
That didn't happen. You would've told me right away.
Don't worry about it. I have a thing. A thing of soup. Which I've been wanting to try.
Andy, you gotta check this out. He just showed me.
That was really good, Darryl.
What? No, no, no! Come on! This is real!
We, uh, we haven't talked about. But I think that she'sI think she understands... what this is.
Oh, its happening!  Lets just keep it between you and me for right now.
Not even a thought!  It's not even that far away! I could still commute! Exactly. Exactly! Alright!
Ok, but wait. What if I told you that it was in Philly! So you'd have to...
Something cool. Like, sports marketing or... that sound something like you'd be into?
Like hypothetically if I said there was another job. That you and I could both have.
Oh, come on, it can always get better. Right?
Yeah. Not the easiest day to be assistant regional manager.
Hey! Can I talk you? For a second?
I think I got it right here.
Uh, what happened to that video I sent you?
I deserved that.
You got it.
Getting my wife a week off from work.
That's impossible, cause that's a brand new bag... Oh my god.
Ah! There's my popcorn. Can you just grab that for me?
Why would you say that? I meant 4 apple, 4 blueberry, 2 cherry, 1 peach and 1 chocolate. I thought that was implied.
You mean Laverne's Pies Tires Fixed Also?  Yes we will be doing that. We'll be getting a dozen.
You got it.
So it looks like this work bus was a pretty good idea after all, huh?
What are you talking about? You're not the boss. Andy is. Andy?Phyllis, Kevin & S
You're the boss. Don't you think we'd all be a lot more productive if while we were doing work we looked up and saw the best rural pie stand in Pennsylvania?
Hey, Dwight. I was trying to do something nice for Pam.  Can you just, help me out? Can we maybe take this thing somewhere? Or do something to not make this the worst day ever?
Pam, I'm really sorry. I- I'm really sorry about...all that.  Really? Smirking?
I'll get you a napkin. Someone get napkins please!
I'm so sorry for all of this.
Alright, alright, gang. Let's just settle down. You're yelling in her face.
He's fine. He's indestructible.
He's just mad that we're all having fun.
If by lately you mean the last twelve years, yeah.
What are you doing?
That's impossible.  Dwight!
When do we want it?!
What do we want?!
Oh no, I'm gonna push him. You know why? Because you're getting a pie. Why? Cause you deserve it. And what is he doing? He's trying to drive us all around the countryside looking for gas because he knows we won't get there. Is that what we want?!
Are you kidding me? Dwight, come on!
OK, well I saw a station about a mile back so, chop chop.
Let's go driver!  Laverne packs up the pie wagon at five so...
You know he's doing all this on purpose.
I'll take it.
Is this about the popcorn? Or the X on the ceiling? Dwight, that was a prank.
That doesn't matter.
OK. And they're all dangerously close to not getting pie. And there's only one guy who can save them. It's not me.
Well, now you have a bus full of real..bilden..kin..
We bonded. We got to-
It's pretty good actually.
We did it.
It wont budge.
Sure I am. I am... one of the Men in Black guys.  Can I have your sunglasses?
Ceces really into princesses now. So we decided to turn them into a positive female role models.
Gettin a lot of mileage out of this, arent ya?
Theres a big investment lunch today, so I decided to skip the costume.
Okay. Ill see you in a little bit.
Youre the best.
All right.  Awesome. Cool.
We were thinking somewhere between five - ten thousand? I can do the full ten thousand. We should just -  - all in.
Oh, I actually talked to my wife and wed really like to uh you know, invest - get in on the ground floor.
Oh, uh, is it too late to get in?
It was very clear that ten thousand was what we had...we should talk about it later.
You werent there.
No, no, I had to. Look, I needed to look like a team player, Pam.
They werent really talking that much about money. They just said, Were good with investing and then I...and I...
Um, oh man, I dont actually know.
What is it?
Yeah. Yeah. Its a good thing we talked about it though, because we had to...
Ten. It was the full ten.
Uh, man, by the end I guess it was about... ten...
I did, yeah.
Oh man, it was great. They were great.
Well talk about it later.
Because it is Halloween. So if youre going to sing a concert, its a good idea to throw that one in.
Okay. Well, just forget it.
Angela, its Halloween. You have to sing Monster Mash.
And his brother, Walt Jr., locked himself in the wine cellar.
No, you chose yourself.
Yes. He is. And you know what? We cannot let that happen.
What the heck is going on?! The stock prices are plummeting! Are you gonna take control of the message or do I have to send in someone who understands the media?!
Uh, this Wallace guy is lookin' at hard time. And we only know this because of what Dwight Snoot said on record!
Go ahead David, Im listening.
I cant. I have the thing.
Okay, Ill call you right back.
Im gonna try a different spot. Okay?Business p
Um, you know what?  I.. should have just had... I should have just had you call me on my cell.Business p
Oh,  Sorry, I uh... was just saying that we should uh...Business p
Uh yeah. Trust me, Id rather be with you guys.Business p
I uh, I have some ideas, actually...Business p
Right. Okay, uh, over the next three months...
Yeah, Im here. Are we all on?Business p
No, no, no.
It was, uh in the authentic design, right? So I mean, you really felt like Michael Jordan was wearing these shoes, so ...
The... the... the... what I was saying is the real genius was... was in the...
Uh, what does -- what does that mean?
Yeah. No, I know. This whole telecommuting thing -- not ideal. But dont worry. Ill figure it out.
Hey man. I am so sorry about that.
What? Yeah, right. As if.
You got this, Beesley. Actually, do you want me to come down and help you get started?
This is gonna be awful.
Hey David, how would you like a guy whos not here as much, gets paid the same amount of salary, and has bigger fish to fry in Philadelphia?
I could have prevented that. So I have to talk to Wallace. P
Unfair. Whens my birthday?
Because were friends.
Phyllis! Wow. S
Shuckin the peas. You should go back to the first part, though. You are gonna cover for me? S
Phyllis, what was that?Phyllis are you dreaming, or--
So you know my job has something to do with sports, but you don't know the end of the word "Philadelphia"?
Yes! That, that, that! We're definitely doing that. Are we all in agreement?
Yeah, I think so.
Yes, he is finally nigh. D
So he's kind of like santa, except dirty and worse.
Okay, so you made a list, you checked it twice, and now you're gonna find out who's--
Oh, nice. Did you check that list?
Quick question--Do you just decide who gets what in the moment, or did you make a list?
Oh, it's like naughty or nice. D
That's enough, I'm done! Okay? Agh!
Ow! Ow! Okay, that is three, and you didn't hit anybody that hard.
Ooh! Are you nuts?
You know what? Yeah. Have at it. D
Perfect. Merry Christmas, everybody. D
I have to go to philly. But this was amazing. Okay.
Oh, you know what? I gotta go.
No. I just missed my wife.
What are you doing? Last time I saw you, you were whipping me out of the building. D
What's going on? Where's the belsnickel?
Go get 'em.
Hey, of course. D
Oh, hey, man.  Oh, you know what? Before I forget again, I talked to the guys about hiring you. They're gonna bring you in for an interview.
Ooh, nog it. Let me get some nog.  Thanks, Phyllis. Where's Andy?
Bynum, obvious monster and the three point shooting, don't even-...
I think they're going to the conference finals.
Okay, you need to think about it before you come with the...
Love you too. Bye.
Uh, you know what, I gotta hop off because my, uh, taxi is here to take me to the meeting.
Uhh, a little bit. It's a lot of pressure, you know, but that's what I signed up for right?
You gotta be kidding me.
Oh no, no, no. That's ok.  Um I'm sorry, is this the conference center?Limo D
I love it.
Okay, bye.  So sorry about that.
Yes, it is very stressful. You sure everything's okay?
It's still happening right now actually, so uh...
Right!  Hey, what's up? Everything ok?
Alright.  Oh, sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my wife, can I take this?
Listen, I don't mean to intimidate you, but I did play a little high school ball.
Are you kidding me? I can literally scalp tickets to this.
No one will believe this back home, but that's okay. Let me show you how it's done.
And that's all?
Okay, I'm Kareem. That makes total sense. I'm Kareem. You're Dr. J. Just sounds weird to say out loud.
Huh. How long would it take me if I drove 300 miles an hour?
Hey, Im in Philadelphia right now.
Okay. Theres no possible way I can get there, so just ask Phyllis. She can be your older sister or something.
Sorry, Stinky, cant do it. Too busy.
Thats so great!
What are you doing here?
Thanks Dennis, I appreciate it.  Hey! How are you?
Weeks. Always weeks. Man, the last time I talked months was like, a million weeks ago.
No, I hear what youre saying, and we will. The thing is, we gotta lock down this key demographic first. The rest will come, I promise. Just give me a couple weeks, alright?
Lets do it!
Yeah?  You ready?
Are you cool to just hang out?
Well, I mean, I dont even have the paycheck yet. It is a startup, so These things go down all the time.
And as you know, I was a paper salesman.
Okay, so the consensus was that that was unique. Theyre going to make you pay for the fish, and they wanted to know when you can start.
I think Im a little too busy these days to s---  Oh ,my God. I did send Dwight on a quest for the Holy Grail.
Okay. Can we keep it on the early side, though? I got that thing in Scranton later.
Bye.  Yep. See, youve still got to press End, Pam. C
Youre gonna do great. And you know what? Mommys gonna record it. So well watch it together. Do you mind doing that, Pam?
Its insane. This huge investor got cold feet, so Im stuck here trying to keep him on board. P
Hey. I was just about to call you. P
Oh, actually... uh, nope. That is my wife. Again, hell be calling in any second.
Uh, Wade actually has those on the road, but hes gonna be calling in with those numbers any second. So just hold on one s--
I dont know how else to tell you, okay? Im doing everything I can every week to bring home something...
We lost Bridgeport Capital. I have no idea what happened. Its like everything I did, he just wouldnt go for it. P
Im talking to him this afternoon, but dont get your hopes up. P
Im just gonna call you back. Thanks.
I need you to breathe in my face right now. C
Nice. Music. Do you listen to it in earbuds? You dont listen to it at all because were at work, not a Florence and the Machine concert, so
Yeah, absolutely.  Do people like sitting next to you? Youre clean, right? C
Sure, yeah, go ahead. C
That seems inconsiderate. R
Well, you know, Wallace put me in charge, so you have no say. D
Take care of my wife. I will be back.
All right. P
And this dude labels his food. He's the clean one. And, I'm the messy one. How much fun is this?
I'm couching it!
And, as much as I miss Pam and the kids, it's, uh, kinda nice to live the bachelor life again. You know, let your hair down.
Who is this guy? We are killing it.      D
Honestly, I don't mind.  Did you want me to wash it for you or...
Oh. It's your go-to therm. Oh, man. That's a bummer. I'm sorry about that.
Oh, um... Are you really mad about this?
Oh, man! I'm sorry about that.
Nice job, man.
What's that cooler?
It's all good. Are we all good? D
Darryl, it doesnt matter. I think you know the point I'm trying to make.
No, I'm not making bread.
That's not the point.
I think you might be going a little crazy with this labeling thing, man. I mean, you put your name on a five pound bag of flour. Are you honestly saying that if I needed flour I couldn't use that?
I don't think you had to.
It's mine. Don't worry. D
How good did that feel?
By the way, they do need an extra day next week.
It's like magic. Or, it's like me getting on my hands and knees and begging my partners to switch a Tuesday for a Thursday.
Yeah, yeah. No, totally. That's good. So, should we just get a bottle of wine later and celebrate?
Oh my god. That's less romantic.
Oh my god. That's so romantic.
They are terrible.
Are you kidding? Thank you, man. I mean, I've wanted the opportunity to say thanks for... everything. And I'm really sorry about the job. That just seems crazy.
Well, I mean, that's OK. It doesn't mean that it's over. Right? I mean, couples fight.
No, you're right. And, and I'm not mad at Brian. And to be honest, I probably don't have any reason to be mad at all because I wasn't there. So, let's just forget about it.
Yeah, well. Yeah, OK. Well, then thank you. Thanks to both of you. P
OK. All right, put your dukes up, Beesly.
Oh, um.  Happy Valentine's Day. Sorry, I didn't have time to wrap it.
I just feel like we're gonna fight.
Yeah. I just feel like I got a bunch of stuff to do in Philly and I'm sure you have stuff to do. So we can just... I don't know, drop me at the bus station?
I've gotta go, but you know what? Team Halpert, ok? You're gonna crush it, you're gonna smash it. OK, good luck!
Call you right back. What were you saying?
You are gonna crush it. Wow, I missed you.
Ok, I know where you're going with this, and this is who I am now. I'm a douche. But look what I can do with my hands.
You look great.
Hey! There she is.  How you doin?
Alright, love you.
I'll make it worth your while, I promise.
I can't wait to hear about it later. Do you want to come in at eight? And uh, don't eat because I'm ordering in.
Hey, how'd the interview go?
Alright. So, tell me all about it.
Are you kidding? We're in Philly. We're having dinner together. And this is just consolation champagne. It's from the part of France that immediately gave up to the Nazis. Here.
Oh man. I'm so sorry. Are you alright?
Hey! Back here.
And I have started a business in Philadelphia.
Huh. This is a little out of left field.
What do you mean? Of course it will. You're amazing.
So, next interview has to be better.
That's amazing. Well, listen. You can't win 'em all, right?
I'm sorry, how did you think I was expected to guess that?
Not Night at the Roxbury.
You're definitely hoarding this by the way.
Tell me about the cologne. How much?
OK. Now, what do we got in these two pails?
OK.  This is crazy. You can't make a dirt ball.
Ooh, red velvet. I should apologize too.Todd P
Yeah. So, uh, I'll uh, talk to you later?
Yeah, yeah. Exactly. P
Not that Ryan Howard. Um, the Phillies' first baseman. P
What was I gonna- What was I gonna say?
Oh boy, please don't. Let's not let that happen. P
Sure, yeah.  Alright. D
Space dust. D
Based on his nickname. Like it already. Let me guess, it's autobiographical. Ryan H
Yep. Ryan H
Right? Ryan H
We're gonna get him.
We'll look into it. Ryan H
Wow. I tell you what, it's really strong. I can't wait to read the rest of it later and see how it ends. D
Megan, I was too shy to tell you this when I was just a normal professional baseball player, but I love you.Ryan H
Buy me some peanuts and cracker jacks.Ryan H
Thats all right.
No, no, no, no, no. Uh, were just starting couples counseling. Uh, which doesnt sound any better.
Okay. I was wondering if you ever did any couples counseling.
You guys obviously went through some tough times leading up to it.
Sorry. Ino, no, no, what I meantwhat I meant actually was
I wanted to talk to you about your divorce.
Its a little, uh, personal.
Thats kind of an impossible question.
What do you mean?
Yes, we are supposed to look for every chance to acknowledge and appreciate each other's sacrifices. Because I need to appreciate what Pam's been doing to run the house while I'm in Philly. P
No shame in that. Get it all out in the open. P
Hey that's work, hold on. Hey Wade, did Cole Hamels call back or what? Great. Good. P
Well, you know how much I appreciate the opportunity to hang out with your mom more. So let me just put this in my calendar. P
I love you.
Beesly! Oh, my god.
But that doesnt matter. This does. Its the only thing that matters. Weve had some really nice days together.
Uh, well, it took me a while, but I finally realized that I cant give 100% to two things at once you know.
Ah, definitely blue.
Thats pretty good. I feel safe.
Okay. The annex it is. Ill be sitting at your desk if thats okay with you.
You totally have. You have earned this. But maybe I could be with my wife. Kind of the whole reason that Im here.
Yeah. Definitely. Go Phillies, right. You dont watch baseball. I keep forgetting that.
I get it.
Oh, wow. But, umOh, I get that. P
Hey, if there is someone out there who loves paper more than Dwight, I definitely dont want to meet that person.
Youre gonna want to invest in a lot more liability insurance, but, uhDavid W
Not at all. It should be Dwight.David W
I wouldnt be too sure about that. Just saying.
No. He was maybe thinking of you for it. D
Hey, congratulations on that black belt, man. Its really great.
You come so prepared. Aspirin.
Oh, also, while youre at it, if you did have a salt packet, three tacks and some aspirin, that would be great. Oh, wow. You have that.
Anything would help.
If you could help me out, that would be
Well, then, I should figure out things to do while Im waiting.
Im sure you did not. What was your question?
All right? Im gonna wait.
I need you to stay right here while you think about it.
Yeah, totally you did.
Thats true, yeah.
Weeknights are actually tough just because
Look whos back.
Ill tell you what I could accept is assistant to the regional manager. That is a real job and one Id be proud to take. D
Nope. Cant accept that job. Its not a real job.
Lets hear it.
Oh, dont look at me cause I think youre making a terrible choice. A
You know, Andy, you could just say a really nice goodbye.
This, man. I cant do this to Pam. D
Oh, man. Yeah, I cant do it.
Wow, that is wow.
Oh, my god!
What kind of offer?
No, I just saw I missed their call. Why? Whats up?
Aw, thanks, man.
I will. I will.
All depends on the conference room meeting itself.  Uh, okay.
Gotta write that down. Ok, big day today. Airing of the documentary. Whos excited?
Thats obviously nonsense. Nonsense. And what percentage of nonsense do we tolerate in this office?
Yes, beautiful girl in the front.
Lets not get crazy and ruin our no-nonsense streak, all right? So, for instance, if youre expecting a fax today, please dont yell out, Michael J. Fax from Fax to the Future. Ok? Thats nonsense.
Your agenda-taking pleases him.
He welcomes you.
Well, I know this sounds crazy, but how would King Arthur choose the next knight of his round table?
Yeah, right. I mean, unless theyre willing to pass some tests.
But what about the assistant assistant to the regional manager?
Obviously, the assistant to the regional manager.
Im gonna need you to look at your hierarchy mobile. Youve got a regional manager.
Potential future nonsense.
My god, Im so sorry. Well this might make up for i
I love Star Wars as much as the next guy
He envies you.
This is not an excuse to blow off work doing carnival-like activities. Sure, every participant will be getting a corndog, but thats for fueling only. No savoring.
Today we will be testing candidates for the position of assistant to the assistant to the regional manager.
Whoa. How did you know that I was gonnaJim & D
Come on. Jim & D
Ew, the exact opposite, actually.
Thats exactly what I was doing. Plop, what animal am I picturing?
Oh, my god! It was the theme song to Boy Meets World.
Okay, Pam. What song is running through my head right now?
Well see. You are an assistant whos just gotten a phone message. I am in a meeting with Dwight, Robert Dunder, and his niece. Uh-oh, look who came to join us. The Turkish ambassador to Armenia, Yuri Slovak, who, by the way, is extremely embarrassed about the size of his nose. Go ahead and read that phone message.
Do you want a corn dog?
What Im about to say makes no logical sense, and yet, it might be the most logical thing Ive ever said.
You know, Dwight, this whole search for the assistant thingnone of these people are good enough.
Look at that form.
Yeah. Its real. Its the only way youll learn. OK, and go ahead.  Oh, god, nice! Shes through the green, everybody. Here comes yellow, real doozy. Careful!
I think you might want to kneel for this. And yet, the manager for Dunder Mifflin kneels for no one.  Thats it. You look really, really good.  D
Is that really what you think?
I dont know how else to tell you.
You did not force me to do this.
You didnt force me.
This was my decision, not yours.
Yes, Im happy.
You all right? Whats going on?
Unless you think he cant handle it.
Ooh, I like where this is going. Unfortunately I have a lot of work today so Im gonna have to hand this off to my number two. But, dont worry, hes the best in the biz.
Perform a test.
You threw the summoning bag at me, sir?
Ok, um, this is Ill be right back.
I have an assistant now, who can help you with whatever you need. He is lazy, so crack the whip. D
OK, I dont have my pocket code chart on me, right now, so.
Well Ive been trying to tell you how I feel, and you wouldnt believe me, so  I needed a little help.
So what is the problem?
