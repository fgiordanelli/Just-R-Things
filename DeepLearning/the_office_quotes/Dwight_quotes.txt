Safety violation. I could fall and pierce an organ.
You can't do that.
It's overlapping. It's all spilling over the edge. One word, two syllables. Demarcation.
Just clearing my desk. I can't concentrate.
OK. You tell 'em. With my permission. Permission granted.
Please, OK? Do you want me to tell 'em?
OK, um, can you just tell me please? Just tell me quietly. Can you whisper it in my ear?
I'm Assistant Regional Manager. I should know first.
Pam, information is power.
On his mother's grave.
New engine, new suspension, I got a respray. I've got some photos.
Uh... yeah I got a '78 280Z. Bought it for $1,200. Fixed it up. It's now worth three grand.
That's real professional thanks. That's the third time and it wasn't funny the first two times either Jim.
He put my stuff in Jell-O again.
OK, that's great. I guess what I'm most concerned with is damage to company property. That's all.
It's always you. Are you going to discipline him or not?
OK you know what, you can be a witness.  Can you reprimand him?
That is my stapler.
Well, it should be.
Retaliation. Tit for tit.
Yes I do. I should have done it weeks ago actually.
I figured it would save time.
I'm sorry. It's an orientation. It's not a race. Plus a lot of other races are intolerant of gays, so...paradox.Mr. B

Um... Shalom. I'd like to apply for a loan.
Lots of cultures eat rice, doesn't help me.
OK, I take it back, it's a workspace.
Bigger than his.
OK, we'll table that for the time being. Two, I'll need an office. I think the conference room should be fine.
In the wild, there is no health care. In the wild, health care is, "Ow, I hurt my leg. I can't run. A lion eats me and I'm dead." Well, I'm not dead. I'm the lion. You're dead.
So I can lower it.
I don't need them. Superior genes. I'm a Schrute. And superior brain power. Through concentration, I can raise and lower my cholesterol at will.
Don't need it. Never been sick. Perfect immune system.
Aww, times are tough, Pam. Deal with it.
Yes. And my decision in final.
Oh gee, then why do I have an office?
Just knock, Please? As a sign of respect for your superior.
I can handle that.
Yeah, you said... M
It's a great plan. It saves the company a fortune.
OK, well, I didn't say to write your name down, did I? Fill it out, leave it anonymous. Or, don't write any disease down at all and it won't be covered. Sound fair? Good. I'll be in my office.
I know it was you. Fine. You know what? I'll have to interview each and every one of you until the perpetrator makes him or herself known. And until that time, there will be no health care coverage for any one!
Yes you did.
You did this, didn't you?
Uh, leprosy? Flesh eating bacteria. Hot-dog fingers. Government-created killer nanorobot infection.
Uh, someone forged, uh, medical information and that is a felony.
Jim! Damnit! No! Jim! Let me out! Jim! Let...
What are you doing? Those are my keys.
I think you need to confess... J
Why did you write that down Jim? Is it because you know I love Count Chocula?
Jim! Open the door!
Yes I can. I'm manager for the day. Clean out your desk.
Let me out or you're fired.
Let me out.
Oh, this is your cell, I thought this was your...
Call you immediately. Good. Oh, hey, listen, um, since I have you on the phone, um, can I fire Jim?
That's not entirely true, because he put me in charge of picking the health care plan.
He is not here right now. He put me in charge of the office.
Hi. Dwight Schrute calling, acting manager, Scranton branch. Listen, I needed your permission to fire Jim Halpert.
Uh, hello. Uh, this is Dwight Schrute calling for Jan Levenson-Gould.
I thought your vagina was removed during your hysterectomy?
You know what? You have forfeited that privilege. I have tried to treat you all as adults, but obviously I am the only adult here. Number one, inverted penis.
Yeah, but no one here has it.
I most certainly did not.
Bottom line. Do I need to be worried?
Yeah, so I don't have to worry?
I, but if there were, I'd be protected as assistant regional manager?
I wanted to talk to you about the downsizing?
I didn't do it. What do you mean? Oh, the water cooler was brought over here for... maintenance. So what do you guys hear? What's the scuttlebutt?
Good, good. Excellent, OK. Now we need to figure out who's vulnerable and who's protected...
Do you want to form, an alliance, with me?
The gun show.
Jim! Hey. Hi, Pam. Listen, could I talk to you a second about the... paper products?
Right, that's good, good, pursue this.
Only one way to find out.
I could tell, from the body language.
What? I believe it.
Oh, they're forming an alliance
Good, let 'em. It helps our cause.
God... Damn it! Why us?
It could be kind of funny.
That's where they remove the uterus.
She had a hysterectomy.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I don't think she'd be missed.
Hey, you wanted to see me?
I know. I know exactly what to do.
No no, yes there is. Behind the shelves. Oh my God.
Oh my God, we have to be there.
Look, I can breathe just fine. OK, but if it makes you feel better, I'll poke holes in the box.
So tape it down.
No, you need to go upstairs to the party so people don't notice we're both gone.
I have absolutely no idea.
That's politics baby. Get what you can out of someone, then crush them. I think Jim might have learned a very valuable lesson.
From the downsizing.
If I find a joke for you, will you grant me immunity?
Okay. Hey Meredith, where's your uterus?
It could be kind of funny.
That's where they remove the uterus.
She had a hysterectomy.
Name, Meredith Palmer. Uh, personal information, divorced twice, two kids. Uh, Employer, Dunder Mifflin Paper Incorporated. Awards, multiple Dundies.
I don't think she'd be missed.
You wanted to see me?
And that's why you have an assistant regional manager.
I can handle that.
I apologized for that.
Michael, can I talk to you, please? Privately? In your office? I think I should be on the team.
OK, we'll see who's working this weekend then.
Assistant team manager?
Can I be team manager?
Can I be team captain?
Michael, look.  Missed it...
Just trying to be helpful.
De-fense! Michael and D
What? Shirts on or off?
OK, we'll be skins!
In your face!
Here, give me that. You have to break the interior bag.
Please. Please, I am your inferior and I'm asking you this favor. Can you promise me that it will just be a ride home? M
It's actually better this way. M
Mine are at home in a display case above my bed.
That is defacement of company property. So you better tell me. Kelly, if you tell me, you'll be punished less.
What is it? Who wrote it?
Who? Dave Barry?
So who are we laughing at?
I am not.
What were you doing in there?
No, why were you in there?!
...no, no, no, no, it's not what you think.
No, no, no, no...
...for people's behavior.
Nnnnno, there needs to be repercussions...
Be prepared to hold folks  From 9 am to...
We are going to have two men's rooms.
Best Dundies ever.
Before we get started, a few announcements. Keep your acceptance speeches short, I have wrap it up music, and I'm not afraid to use it.  Devon!
The waitress tripped on the cord.
Like an AIDS test?
Really? We don't have any girls from HR.
Ahh! I can't-
It's okay, I'm going to use my shirt.
Don't get into that now. We need something to cushion her head. Throw pillow? A cush-
Quick, quick, the woman is having a seizure. Grab her tongue, grab her tongue! It's okay, I'm a sheriff's deputy.
Thanks, I had to, uh, check her pupils to make sure there wasn't a concussion.
Watch your step.
Okay, I'll talk. You nod if I get it right. Does it have to do with his butt or his wiener?
I'm not asking what you do in there. I just want to know what's written about Michael.
Yeah, you know me.
Where is the clitoris? On a website, it said at the crest of the labia. What does that mean? What does the female vagina look like?
You said that we could come to you if we had any questions.
Good. Good. And... T
And it worked. They should bring the stocks back. People'd obey the law, there'd be less troublemakers.
Same thing. M
Yes! As your representative?
Please, I'll make you proud.
Please, I'm always the guy you rely on at work. M
I'm good. I can make sure things are up to code.
I think I should be there.
Can I be your representative?
You have your lawyer there?
Check it out.  Terminator.
But then no one can see us. M
I want to put the top down. M
Which one's yours?
Actually, no. We have a couple of questions, about the neighborhood. B
Listen.  Can you hear that? Oh man. These babies are thin.
Warrantees don't cover it, plus they're a rip-off. M
No, no, no, no, no. This is a shared wall. Neighbor throws his wife into the wall, plasma screen hits the floor. Totally smashed. M
What kind of mortgage did you get?
Totally having fun. Can you imagine those poor saps stuck at the office today?
You didn't have to...
It's a fish tank for snakes and lizards. M
Question. Who is the primary on the fire insurance?
Just for fun?
Question. Can sometimes I drive your car and you drive mine?
People love beets. M
That's my stopwatch.
What is going on?
Nice try.  Cancel card. Cancel card. Cancel... card.
I'm serious. What did you do to it?
What did you do to it?
Please, move quickly! This is a paper company, people! Step lively! A
No, panic is warranted! A
Get up off your desks! A
Head towards the exits.
This is not a test! Move to the exits!
You should learn from him, right? R
Everyone, okay? Uh, I have an announcement. Apparently, in business school, they don't teach you how to operate a toaster oven. Because some smart, sexy temp left his cheese pita on oven instead of timing it for the toaster thing. M
... Marilyn Monroe! Dwight and M
I am a Sith Lord.  Oh big deal. Three round pieces of paper taped to a shirt. This cost me 129 dollars.
Yeah, well look...  What about me?
Stanley. Pam. Oscar. Meredith. Kevin. Angela.
Make him be quiet.
Tell him to stop.
Tell him, not Dwight.
I know that's what he said.
No, not me.
Who is he saying?
Look! I've got some bad news. You're fired. You need to pack up your things and go.  I'm serious, Stanley. It's over.  I'm sorry.
As Assistant Regional Manager... S
If you want to fire him, you're going to have to tell him yourself.
He wouldn't listen to m
I can't. I... I suppose I coul... no. They never really made me an offer anyway.
It's in Maryland.
But then you wouldn't have me here.
... so I was hoping to be made Assistant Regional Manager officially.
Out of loyalty to this company... M
And I turned it down.
I just thought you should know that I was just offered a job with better pay, better benefits and a better title at Cumberland Mills.
Wash your hands, Kevin.
...now, $9.78, signs and discounts 7%.
It's by the ream?
Jim, I've given you this information, like, twenty times.
Ok, I am going to tell Michael and this entire office will be punished!
Okay, who moved my desk?
I didn't lose my desk.
This is not funny.  This is totally unprofessional. J
I am now Sempai, which is Assistant Sensei.
No, that was my Sensei.
Yes, I just had a ques-... Yes Sensei. Arigatou gozaimashita. Hai.
Ok, give that back to me.
Look, I'm going to offer you a little piece of advice. I'm not afraid to make an example out of you.
Impossible. The way they're programmed... You're mocking me.
Because we're friends.
Ok, I'll punch you.
Michael, I told you, it was because it was New Year's Eve and it began to snow at exactly midnight. M
What belt are they?
No, I would block your first punch rendering it ineffective.
In case you remember, I was defending my honor... like a samurai.
I didn't sucker punch you, Michael. M
Now watch, let me take you from behind.
Take this pen and stab me with it. M
No, stop it! Come on! Michael.
I'm busy. M
Just a formality.
I can handle it. I can. Wow. So I guess this will just be my office.
I can... Yes, sensei.
It's a sales call.
Okay, I just...
Good luck, Michael. Good luck, Jan.
Brought it in here-
You took something that doesn't belong to you.
Ok, you guys should not be doing this.
Not in a thousand years, Catherine.  We work together.  And get off my desk!
Ok, what are they?
Pow! Pow! Pow!
Thank you for noticing.  Now keep me company for one more mission.
Samuel, you are such an idiot, you are the worst assistant ever.  And you're disgusting, Dwigt.  Wait, who's Dwigt?
Yes, perhaps I would, Goldenface.  Sam, get my luggage.
Uh, you don't speak for everyone, Jim. Ok, announcement.  My uncle bought me some fireworks.  Anyone who wants to see a real show, come with me outside now.
And she is your boss.
Did you do her?
Did you do her?
It's only twenty-five bucks.
Plus, improves your reflexes  see, I would have caught that.
Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.
This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.  Sorry.
Do you even know what this is?  It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.  Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.
Ugh, you know what?  I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.  I need to stay focused, and I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go on Monday.  Uh, stupid.
Uh, that is so stupid.  What if he gives it to you?
Yeah, it's a new product.  So, you should just suggest that to him and he'll be sure to give you a raise.
Oh, yes, we do.
Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.
No, I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.  Crap!  I never go out on a Thursday night; what the hell was I thinking?
Who?  Who was it?  Who did he fire?
"Don't sleep with your boss"? Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan?
Yeah, who wants to come in on a Saturday?
To do something about-
You need to do something about your B.O.
It happens occasionally.
What should we do to prepare for Y2K?
It's a delicacy.  And you know what?  It's an aphrodisiac.  So when we're done here, you guys could go over to The Antler Lodge, sample some deer and talk about my raise.
Jan, have you ever had deer?
You liked it!
For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office. M
I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.
I have a copy of your key.
That is an excellent question. Thank you for asking.  Let me bring up one w
I am ready for my performance review.
Smallville.  And that is why, I feel, that I deserve this raise.
Or a bus or a train. Get poisoned, fall in a well, step on a mine, choke.
Or get hit by a car-
Yeah, but that doesn't matter, you could get a brain aneurysm-
Look, Michael, I know you don't want to have to think about this, but if something were to happen to you, God forbid, then I would need to know in order to take over.
You have to tell me.
Ok, I'm sorry.  What is going on in there? Why is he here?  What are you doing?
So it's true?  You have access to our e-mails?
Does he have access to their medical records?
Oh, that's perfect!
Why just Michael?
Like who?  Who doesn't know?
I was wondering-
Have fun tonight!  Whatever it is that you're doing, and I'll see you Monday.   He has no idea!
Unfortunately, I've got plans. I have to go to practice.  Soccer practice.  M
He's gonna love it!
When is the guest of honor coming?
You don't work with us.
Jim!  You really think this is a good idea, huh? A hide-a-key rock? M
One, two, three.
I've got it leveraged. Push. Straight up.
I got a splinter.
Shove it through! Break it!
Really shove it.
You guys should use a hand truck.
Michael, I would like to be the elf.
Hey, I could get some flares from my car.
I want to do it.
All right, next. Ryan.
We don't do anything until Michael gives us further instructions.
Yes, now you can steal the oven mitt, the old shirt or the shower radio or pick a new gift.
Angela, you're up.
It's already been stolen this round. Pick something else.
Okay, moving along. Meredith, let's go.
I never said it was better than an iPod.
You and me, Michael. Yes!
Yes! There you go. I want the teapot. Gracias.
True. But I get sinus infections, and sinus infections can be cured by making your tea from green tea leaf stems .. J
No. I want it. I'm going to use it.
"A real man makes his own luck." Billy Zane. Titanic.
You shouldn't do things like that. The man is supposed to do that.
Oh, hello there.  But what are you doing?
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five...
But I don't have any... J
Okay, fine. Where's my wallet?
Uh, I think so, and you're going to hand it over to me.
No, no, no, no, no. That's my pencil cup.
Yeah, Steve, whatever his name is.
Yeah, well, I'm not paying for my own stuff, okay? I know you did this, because you're friends with the vending machine guy.
This is not funny. Why is my stuff in here?
Good morning, Michael.
Aye aye, Captain.
I'm stronger.Captain J
Limbo, whoo!Captain J
I can't. Do you want us to run aground, woman?!
Yeah. He gives me real responsibility, Michael. Captain Jack delegates. He's let me steer the ship for the last hour.
Wow. You should be the motivational speaker.
If the hull is breached for any reason or the boat is overtaken, I am a volunteer Sheriff's Deputy, and you can count on me.Captain J
You know, my grandfather told me there was a monster here that eats Catholics. Have you heard...Captain J
Okay, okay. My turn, my turn. Is this thing on? Uh, I want to congratulate the happy couple. You know, they say that marriage is an institution. And I say, who wants to be in an institution?
I'm coming Michael!
What is going on? What is going on?
What is wrong with you?
No, I didn't.
Hey, Pam, I'm assistant regional manager, and I can take care of him. Part of my duties are to.
Why would they all be...?  Ok, see you later, Pan.
Yeah, I'll write down the address for you.  Only, the only thing is, is that all the songs are in Russian. ... Kidding!
Oh, no no no.  Don't go there.  I know this Russian website where you can download songs for two cents a piece.
Yeah, they're like an i-Pod only they're better 'cause they're chunkier and more solid.
No, it's fine.  I told you it wouldn't break.  You could throw it all day long.
Oh no, it's broken.
Yeah. Throw it.  I promise it won't break.  Chuck it.
Cause you're sweeter than candy.
Oh, huggy hugs.
Aw, Pam, you're adorable
I'll be back, I mean... P
Where we going?
I have to go to the hospital.
It smells like chicken soup.
You're the best.
Want to take a rake... .
Choo choo choo choo choo choo... J
Uh, ugh, ohhhh... J
Where are we going?
Where are we going?
You can't fire me, I don't work in this van!
I found it under the seat.
What is that?
I don't want to do this.
Good. How are you doing?
Oscar is out sick.
Question? May I investigate?
Which is exactly how you'd wanna sound like if you wanted someone to think you were sick.
Ask him his symptoms. I'm on Web M.D.
Ok, let him know that I'm here.
Oh God, here.
Do you think? Or do you know?
I can tell. I won't let you down.
Thank you Michael.  I know your telling the truth.
Is that true?
Ok. So what is the secret Michael?
Oh, really nothing? F
Ok, what is going on here?
Ok, good, thank you.  That wasn't so hard now was it?
So, how did Oscar sound when he called in?
Including prep time?
How bout this. I don't tell Michael and in exchange you owe me one great big giant favor.  Redeemable by me at a time and place of my choosing.
This is Dwight Schrute. Who is this?
It's still stinky.
And who had your office?
Ha ha ha... the old bullpen.
I thought he was out on the road.
Should we help 'em pick up their stuff?
Am I the 107th caller?
Michael is gonna wipe the floor with us!
It is so on!
Them in there all together. If they stay in there too long they're going to get on the same cycle. Wreak havoc on our plumbing.
Yeah and then they make you drive them to Church the next morning. Like "Gas ain't free!"
There was this film that I saw when I was little. It was about a kid who goes on the most incredible adventure. And even though it was really great, and she had a great time, she ends up back home in Kansas and says, "There's no place like home." And that's how I feel right now. There is no place like home. What the hell was that movie called?  It's gonna drive me crazy.
Guys! Check it out! Spudgun! Woohoo! Bon appetit!  Sorry.
Yeah. Shoot a chuck of potato at your face, 80 PSI, bon appetit!
Yeah. I got a spudgun in my car.
Well... It's Valentine's Day, and you guys, you know... M
Question. Will you be seeing Jan when you're in New York?
And you want me to come with you.
Oh, I bet you will before the day is over. A
Oh I did. I did. A
No, Pam, Just. Just,
Ok, shut up. I know exactly what to do.
(smirking) Exactly. P
Girlfriend. Yes, and the reason I didn't get anything for this particular person - who shall remain nameless - is that she's not really the kind of person you'd think would be into Valentine's Day. She's kind of... P
Hut! Hut! Hut! Hike!
Fumble! Yaaah! M
Think it through.
Oh, great. Tasty, terrific pizza. Hmm. Q
Well, it's not really a big speech. You still coming right?
Ha! I don't get it.
Is that an insult or is that part of the public speaking advice?
I'll try and think of one. When... M
Okay, deal! I'll do whatever you say. No questions asked.
Could I have a copy of one of them?
Hey. Do you remember the speeches that you gave?
But I'm right?
Saleswoman has a vagina.
That is so great about the bonus!
He will never act again. Also, this branch is closing.
They are unrelated.
Excuse me! May I have your attention please? There has been an accident on 84 West. Cars have skidded off the road into the safety railing. Several cars have flipped. There is broken glass everywhere. Several people are injured.
Michael, can you explain?
Uh, yes you are. I'm Assistant Regional Manager.
Good morning, Vietnam!  Okay. You know what? This isn't working. Because um I'm not nervous in front of them. They're my subordinates.
Yes. I am.
Oh please! You're not taking any trip.
I'll glance at it.
Thank you, Angela.
No, I can't... I ca... M
Salesman of Northeastern Pennsylvania, I ask you once more rise and be worthy of this historical hour!
WE ARE WARRIORS!
and you'll understand that it is a privilege to fight!
Some people will tell you salesman is a bad word. They'll conjure up images of used car dealers and door to door charlatans. This is our duty - to change their perception. I say salesmen... and women of the world unite! We must never acquiesce for it is together, TOGETHER, THAT WE PREVAIL!  We must never cede control of the motherland! For it is... C
What? Something happened?
It was amazing. I wish you would have been there.
Oh, why not?
Two sailors walk into a bar...
No, no, no. It's totally normal, 'cause she's not a Cylon or anything. She's just a great human fighter pilot. If I see her, my heart will explode.
Oh, yeah, I read about that. The entire cast of Battlestar Galactica is gonna be here, including Starbuck. I'm so in love with her.
You are the future!
Schrute. Mister Schrute. J
You call your mom Meredith? That's very disrespectful.
Little girl. Come over here. Shake my hand. Come on, I don't have all day.  Uh, excuse me, these are expensive collector's items, okay? J
...from the 1930's...
There's a photo...
Well at least I'm not a horrible little latchkey kid who got suspended from school. So...
Uh, okay. But first, that's not my name. J
And they do, your parents, love you very much.
Let's get the party started.
Excellent. On my part, I did manage to reserve the...
Mmm. Maybe I should get one. M
Yes. There he is, the birthday boy!
Not my problem. Here is a list of things that Michael would like to be surprised by.
Party planning committee, listen up. Michael would like trick candles for his birthday cake, so make that a priority.
I probably care more than she does.
One. Two. Three!
Happy birth moment, Michael.
On three, we're going to hoist away! Ready? M
Creed! Come on. Stanley!
There is a tradition that the Hebrews have of hoisting the birthday boy up on a chair.
Listen up everyone! It is 11:23 exactly, the exact moment when you emerged from your mother's vaginal canal, so... huh?! Right, have a seat. Please.
Thirty nine... sixty.
Uh, bologna, tomato and ketchup.
But what if i'm hungry?
What about that meeting... later... to discuss finances?
This is the most important day of the year. I can't risk anything.
Hell, yeah. Save room for ice cream cake. A
Pam was supposed to get 'em.
Here we go. Make a wish.
I'll get someone to take it down.
Turn it around. Turn it around.
...and I am very proud of being a narc.
...because being a narc is one of the hardest jobs that you can have...
If you are attempting to compliment me then you have done a very good job. M
What kind of filing? M
I took an oath when I was sworn in and I broke that oath today.
I need to go over some details with you. M
Thank you, Michael.
Oh! What is on your face? Is that a disguise?
Oh, he's sure. Just shoot.
Whoa.. wha... wait. If someone has a problem with me, why would they withdraw it six months ago?
Okay, question.  When a name is withdrawn, does that also apply to the permanent misbehavior file in New York?
That is not true. Redact it. Redact it!
That doesn't make any sense.
And my middle name is 'Kurt', not 'Fart'.
This is humongous. I am not a security threat... J
Him or me? I cannot work with Jim anymore.
Him or me?
No! You calm down! Who's side is Toby on? Who's side are you on?
Ah... agh... dgh... Ahh! No, no! Four years of malfeasance unreported. This cannot stand.
You have till five.
I deserve this. You know I do!
Do the right thing here, Michael. Okay, I have served you loyally for years.
I have a girlfriend... J
It's a good market. Higher volume.
I want an answer by tomorrow.
So, you going to transfer Jim or not?
Come on, let's go. Creed, Kevin, Oscar... andale! Let's go.
I know. It belonged to my grandfather. He was buried in it, so family heirloom.
I would never, ever serve you. Not in a million, billion years.
Oh, my God.
That's ridiculous. You know what? Uh... Why don't you move that coat rack? Excuse me, everyone! Attention in the office, please. Jim is about to prove his telekinetic powers and he needs absolute silence. Go ahead.
I don't believe you. Continue.
You can't be serious. Are you serious?
How would you do that?
Oh, really? Mmm-hmm.
Impossible. Roulette is not a game of skill, it is a game of chance.
When Darryl was coming, you said you wanted me here for protection. M
Code name Re/Max is here. No sign of Lan Jevinson.
Give me the dice!
Thank you, Angela.
Evening, Angela. This is craps. I need to roll an eight. If I do, everyone wins. K
Holiday Inn? The Hyatt in Wilkes-Barre? You staying with Michael?
Motel 6? Best Western?
Come on.  So where you staying? Radisson?
Come on, shooter!
Nice, very nice.
Yeah, get them, Creed!
It's from Battlestar Galactica.
The planet Caprica.
Well, he's not dressed in women's clothes, so...
I really don't think so.
Jim told me you could buy gay-dar online.
Damn.    I'll try Brookstone.
Uh, Michael knows Pam.  He asked me to do this just for him.  He has his own reasons.
What about Phyllis?  She makes absolutely no attempt to be feminine!
Shhh.  Don't be scared.    ...oh no.
Monkey, I am an A. R. M., Assistant Regional Manager. A
I got it.
I got it.
And your veil.
Well, I did it too.
Shut up. That's impossible.
Oh, hey, how's it going up there? Have you made any sales yet?
You're so immature!
I'll do a shot, Michael.
Check it out.
Why do they call him The Bus?
I'm a huge fan.Jerome B
Dwight Schrute, Assistant Regional Manager, Dunder-Mifflin.Jerome B
No one just called you.
You don't have email on your phone.
I'll talk to my buddy down at the station, stat.
He wasn't volunteering today.
Was that your per diem?
Come on. Nice try, Josh!
Blood, urine, or semen.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
You? A bottle capper?!
What would you have done? Been manager?
Coast Guard? So you know how to fight underwater?
Take a seat down there.  Second from the end.
That's not his fault!  He had to follow his heart!
That's not going to happen.
I could never do that!
Michael would never let me...
Part of my job.
Many of your blouses are Claiborne's.
Pull over at exit 40.  There is a Liz Claiborne outlet.  I know you like that store.  Go inside and shop, until I can meet you.
No, but we should discuss that another time.
I can't talk here.  It's too sensitive. J
It's about Michael.
This is Dwight Schrute.  I am calling about an extremely sensitive matter.
Is this Jan?
Yes.  It's a new dentist.  He's far.  I might be gone... three hours.
I have to have an emergency crown put in.
New blouse?  Halter top?  Camisole?  Teddy?
Mostly get rid of waste.  Which is half the people there.  And clean house.    Right here.  It's all for me.  Thank you.
"Ok" I can run it?
If you let me run it.
Maybe that's why he became a dentist.
They have this new kind of quick drying bonding, so...
No thanks I'm stuffed.
Hey... I can't imagine this place without you.
Assistant to the regional manager.  Thank you Michael, for staying on.   I really appreciate it.
You said that?
I can't believe this news.  That--- wow.
What is it?
Yeah, when I'm ready, Mike.  Ok let's do it.
Thank you Angela.
Oh please, don't be naive.  But you can be in charge of the women.
I, will, make a difference here.
What did you---
Well that was before.  I'm thinking about getting something German, something with decent gas mileage.  Plus, that convertible, it's a ridiculous choice for this climate.
Not my style.
No thank you.
You can't.  You can't.  But I promise I'll never betray you again.  What can I do, Michael.  What can I do?   What can I do?  What can I do?
I'm sorry!  I'll do anything, I swear.
I'll do anything!  Anything!  I'll do your laundry for a month!  For a year!
I HAVE EXCELLENT SALES NUMBERS!
Don't fire me.  Please.
I think the Sebring's cool.  It's cool.  The Seabring's cool.  It has a cassette and it has a CD.
You know what?
Creed might be living here, we could charge him rent.
I know that we need to cut costs.  We could fire Meredith. That's a big cost.
If the branch is in trouble, there are things you can do.
Hey.  Is everything okay?
Michael, can you get me a pen from down in the warehouse?
You're thinking of a chicken.
That is the way to go.  Instant death.  Very smart.
You said you didn't know how to say it.
If my head ever comes off, I would like you to put it on ice.
Look  I gave him a six foot extension cord so he can't chase us.
Mm, no.  Better make it two-thirds.  Easier to stop if it turns on us.
And how big do you want this robot? M
Michael, get him away from your head!  He is covered in germs and bacteria!  M
He is a goner. M
Michael!  Michael.   Michael ... M
I got it.  When my mother was pregnant with me, they did an ultrasound and found she was having twins.  When they did another ultrasound a few weeks later, they discovered, that I had resorbed the other fetus.  Do I regret this?  No.  I believe his tissue has made me stronger.  I now have the strength of a grown man and a little baby. M
You want me to flush him?
What?  No, this is about the right size.
Oh, thank you.  P
He's not a songbird. M
Michael, no need to call corporate. We are supposed to use Toby. He's trained as a grief counselor.
A man is found hanging from the ceiling...
No, I said one of them is not a nickel.
Extremely excited? ... Just very?  That's cool.
When you are ready to see the sales office, the sales office will present itself to you. Your journey begins now.
I hold in my hand, a beet seed. Take it.  When... Damn it.
Oh hey, I forgot something in my car.  I'll be right back. R
It's called bull crap and a client can smell it from a mile away. R
Smells pretty bad, doesn't it?
You know what your problem is? You know why you haven't made any sales? Cause you think you know everything. You have to trust that maybe there are other people that can teach you things. Are you ready to learn? Are you ready for the final test? R
Pay no attention to the spirits that haunt this hallowed ground. R
Wrong. He hated himself. What is the DHARMA initiative?
Wrong. Flash floods. What is the true cause of Robert Mifflin's suicide?
Ryan. Don't. Ryan! You don't have to wrestle him. Just get in the coffin. Ryan?Cousin M
Wrestle him to the ground. R
Screwgun. The sales call!
Michael always said, K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid. Great advice, hurts my feelings every time.
Uh huh. R
Today is Ryan's first sales call and I am bringing this boy home a full-grown man.
...because you are never going to see him again.
Don't you realize the key is inside you?
Get in the car.  Get... get in the car.
What is that in your ear?  A tiny beet seed. You need to clean your ears better.
You know, selling, typing, dialing.
Yeah, totally single. Hundred percent available.
Maybe you've got mono.
I see dead people. M
He does? What does he say.
Does Michael talk about me a lot?
Sorry. I just feel like we haven't talked in awhile.
When you become close with someone, you develop a kind of sixth sense. You can read their moods like a book. And right now, the title of Michael's book is, "Something Weird is Going On." Colon, "What Did Jan Say? The Michael Scott Story. By Michael Scott, with Dwight Schrute."
Can I drive?
But when I do, we'll have something to talk about.
Christmas card list.
But, do not worry. I have his home address right  here.
Dum, dum, dum, du, doy, du, do... coming home from work...
Whoa hey, why not?
Listen, Scott... we're losing money, okay? It's not a charity; it's a business. And it's a dying business.
Well, the branch is no longer finicially viable. It's simple dollars and cents.
Yes? What is the meaning of this?
Dum, dum, dum, dum... coming home from work.M i
No. Bad idea. You need an attack plan. Here, I'll be him, you be you. Let's practice.
Gonna get it?
Well, it doesn't...
What were your favorite moments?
Uh,... my first sale, my promotion to assistant regional manager, our basketball game, when you took me to the hospital, and told me that you cared about me.
My first day when you hazed me by spraying me with a fire extinguisher.
Then it was an honor to have worked with you.
I don't ... have no idea.
In your face!
Oh my God!
Let's just put it this way. Last weekend I outran a black pepper snake.
Yeah, well my feet don't. And I can still crush that time.
I could beat that on a skateboard.
What was your mile time? T
Psh, why is that great?
And you'll compare the times?
Probably Italian. Possibly Filipino.
No, no, no! Not somebody. Gardner.
...before noon... M
...I would fire Anthony Gardner... M
If I were you... M
That's Andy Bernard.
Stop acting like an idiot!
Meet my eye line, Jim! J
Why are you looking at my forehead?
I have a smudge on my forehead?
Fact - I am older. I am wiser. Do not mess with me.
I know everything about film. I've seen over 240 of them.
So you'll be reporting to me, then.
Hello. I don't believe we've been introduced. Dwight Schrute. Assistant Regional Manager.
And then if I want... M
Ok. Who reports to who?
Okay. So who gets paid more? Me or Andy? M
Which is higher? Assistant Regional Manager or Regional Director in Charge of Sales? M
We need to talk!
But check that it's covered by your health care provider!
Yo Mike, our town is dope and pretty.
But the little cars go in the compact spotMichael and D
Do you mean to me? From you? Cause that's how it works.
Really funny, Michael!
Very funny, Michael! M
Hey, hey. Easy.
On three. One... two... three.
Do this. Come on. Ready?
And what advice has Andy given to you today that you have acted on? Would 'none' be an accurate estimate? None advice?  Fire Andy. Fire. Andy.
That was my advice. Remember? I'm the one who suggested that you fire him. M
And I have to say your leadership... M
Totally got the best of that interchange.
You're the idiot!
If you were driving a TransAm, you would be the smartest idiot in the whole world.
Speaking of funerals, why don't you go ahead and go die.
Well I hope 1985 has a time machine 'cause I drive an 87.
That makes sense. I'd rather drive a classic TransAm than an XEarth.
Oh, so you drive an X-Earth?
Xterra's not even a real word.
Uh, try double that. Classic TransAm, vintage American muscle. Please.
It wasn't clear on the Google Image search.
No, no, it's better than fantastic. It's super perfect. M
Sometimes it hurts Michael.
I had a tickle in my throat. M
I'm cool, I'm cool, I'm so cool. Tell me what is going on. M
I am cool.
Prison Mike. What's the very very worst thing about prison?
No, Toby, this is different. He's already dead.
So can you watch this? I'm gonna get my carving knife out of the trunk. T
What does it look like? J
Don't worry, she's dead. Oh wait. He's dead. P
Ok, that is ridiculous. And totally against the spirit of Christmas. T
Exactly. Thank you, Jim.
Michael. Sorry to interrupt. Uh, It appears we're one bathrobe short.
Why don't you just buy the whole song?
Oh, look at this.
We are getting rid of everything that reminds you of Carol.
No no, no, wait, wait, wait  Permission to join the Validity Committee.
Ah, no.  You must turn over to me all Christmas decorations and party paraphernalia immediately that will be returned to you on January fourth. J
You're number four.
As ranking number three in this office, I am order -
Michael! Repeat what you said louder!
I can't... I can't here what you're saying. M
Who are you calling?
Start the party. A
Michael! Hey! Over here, Michael!
Oh, OK. Cindy! Yo, Cindy! Cindy! Hold its neck back and insert the knife below the jaw. Bring it all the way around, there's going to be a good amount of blood.  Don't let it bother you. Have a bucket there, for the blood... and the innards... and the feathers.
Jim! Jim! What... What's happening? J
Hey! It's Angela!  Hey!
No... way! Yeah!
pum pum pum pum pum pum pum
You can't see... You can't see my stomach.
Give me it. I am not. P
Let the record show that Jim Halpert is a liar!
I do not have a knife!
For recording. Michael is on vacation and he's asked me to record all meetings and to type up the transcripts.
Tape recorder. J
Unless you're willing to tell me everything, I cannot accept this assignment. M
What's it of? M
Who's the target?
Michael hit a deer?
No, it's... involves the photograph.
I know.  So you're PMSing pretty bad, huh?
He turned over my...
While you were gone, Jim glued my desk drawers together. He changed my voicemail so that my voice sounded like a chipmunk. He told me that we had a meeting at 4:00 AM, and I was the only one who showed up.
While you were gone...
Two at a time!
Please, I can double your pace.
Everything is fine. You are in the clear.
Yeah! You want shirts on hangers?
Uh, yeah. It's the safest part of the car. In the event of a crash, the driver always protects his side of the car first.
Leave the keys!
Can I use your phone?
Here is my card. It's got my Cell number, my pager number, my home number, and my other pager number. I never take vacations, I never get sick, and I don't celebrate any major holidays. M
No thank you.
That's what she said. M
Stay out of this, you!
I am not a liar. M
I overslept. Damn rooster didn't crow. M
That's not the worst thing in the world. I'll just stand up in front of the office and reveal our true love. It won't be that bad. Look at Kelly and Ryan. A
Child's play. Give me something hard to sell.
Great. I will literally be standing right here if you need anything at all.
Whoa. Really? Have you heard of paper?
Paper company. They're only one of Staples' top competitors in the area. P
I have snow tires and chains. Plus exceptional hand-eye coordination.
I don't get to wear my ties. M
The boss isn't funny. M
Same old. M
You did this for me?
How do you know it's going to be a boy?
I want to do this.
Maybe that's how you die.
What if he's a murderer?
I'm on it.
Nice.  Do you have any blonde women?
No preference, what do you think redhead or brunette?
I knew you would, Nancy.
Leave me alone and get the male stripper.
Is she hot?  Text back, "Kind of."
Oh, okay good.  Well in the future please identify yourself as such.
Okay, I specifically ordered a stripper.
Yes.  Jennifer Garner portrayed one on Alias.  It was one of her many aliases.  J
I do!  I want some man meat!
We hired you for three hours work and we're going to get it.
Who is the king of England?Ben F
Who is the king of Prussia?Ben F
Who is the king of Austria?Ben F
What do you think?
I don't know. My mouth tastes so bad all of a sudden.
You look as beautiful as the Queen of England.
Of course I saw it.
Once again, Jim, I will take care of this. I will locate the wedding crashers and report them to Phyllis. That way I won't have to get her a gift.
It's a miracle.
Got to find yourself another wedding to crash, my friend.Uncle A
Oh I get it, I get it, come on, freeloader. Let's move it. Come on. Come on.Uncle A
The bride and groom? What are their names?Uncle A
You are a real life wedding crasher and I must bounce you. I'm sorry, it gives me no pleasure.
I can't let you in, Michael.
"Don't be an idiot." Changed my life.
BAAAAT! BAT! NO! EVERYONE REMAIN CALM! There it goes!
Do you have the tools to turn a wooden mop handle into a stake?

Animal control? I've been controlling animals since I was six.

Hold still, woman!
You want rabies? Be my guest.
Yes. But this  seems to be...
I know how. Dislocate his shoulder and slip his arm out from underneath.
Let me smell.  Good, not great.
It's early bird gets the worm. M
Talk to you later, Jan.
Hello, Jan. J
That would have been really embarrassing.
Wait. I don't think yours will fit me.
It's from both of us. M
No? Then you are an idiot.
These old colonials are great, when they're sound. I'd love to take a look around.
What do you know?
Pam, please call security!
Don't want it.  Won't open it.  Don't need it.  Won't take it.  Citizens do not accept prizes for being citizens.
Don't want it.
Thank you not necessary and thus, not accepted.  I saw someone breaking the law and I interceded.
Irrelevant.  Discharged it at a distance of a little over a meter into the perpetrator's eyes, nose, and face area.  Rendering him utterly and completely disabled.  Then I contacted the authorities.  The end.
No.  And why are you so interested in buying me something Jim, what's your angle?
When Han Solo returns to the Death Star in the Millennium Falcon, and shoots down the TIE fighters and saves the Rebel cause, do you think he does so for a free beer?
Please.  They hand these out to little kids.  Look.  There's a teddy bear in a policeman's cap.
Certificate of Bravery, from the Scranton Police Department.  "Recognizing outstanding citizenship from a very brave young man.  Dwight K. Schrute"
No need to thank me.
Ok, no.  Jim, tell him that bears can climb faster than they can run.  Jim!  Tell him!
Ok, tell him that's not true.
Idiots!  God, what are we gonna do!?
A quilt.  Depression quilt?
We measured it once...
I'm on it!
We're not allowed to use the baler.
Un-shun.  Yeah that sounds good.  Re-shun.
What do you think?  You've got an hour.
Okay, calm down.  I need you to acquire an inflatable house, and/or castle.
It means nothing.  I need you to do something for me.
Rip a hole in the suuuuuuun!
Bouncin' on the bouncy bounce!  Show 'em who's boss!
Michael is awesome!  Jumpin' off the roof!
Near near near near near!
That's right!  Doing!  Totally doing!  It's rock n' roll!
Do you wanna do another test?  I got plenty of watermelons in my trunk!
When you land, try and land like an eight year-old.  These bouncy castles are not designed for adults.
Everybody's gonna be fine in exactly what they're wearing, let's go!  Let's go!
No really, it's, it's very nice.  Come on!
It's gorgeous.  Let's go!
Un-shun.  Never.  Re-shun.  I think he wants you all to come out to the parking lot and watch him die!
Un-shun.  I think he's suffering from depression. Re-shun.
Okay, I'm on it!
you said to just...
I didn't...  I didn't think you needed them for this part.
Don't do anything rash!
Is that the last year the data was available?
Depression?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael, what's wrong?!
Depressed?  Isn't that just a fancy word for feeling bummed out?
Michael!  What's wrong?
No, there's nothing to see over there, people!  There's nothing to see.  ...They found the castle, Michael.
Oh... It's uh, a Repliee Q1 Expo female robot, they're only available in Japan.
Okay, uh... I don't see anything.  She might be bluffing.
Buddy system, everyone buddy up, find a buddy.
Step lively. Single file everybody.
No it was not. Remind me again, what was the fight exactly, who was it between, and what was the outcome?
OK, ahh, turn around, and do a broad jump for me on go. Ready... Go! One Mississ... OK, you went that far on one Mississ. Ippi would take you to here. This trajectory times the propulsion from your quadriceps would be about three Mississippi, maybe three and a quarter. So one Mississ... correct... ippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi... e. Right here.
Can you tell Andy to focus on the springs? Please.
Come on pretty boy.
OK, if he's not down by four, I'll get the papers up to him.
It's only leased, and it's got rust damage, he'll never get his deposit back.
Bears do not--- What is going on--- What are you doing?!
Well that's debatable.  There are basically two schools of thought---
That's a ridiculous question.
Oh, that's funny.  MICHAEL!
Yes!  You are entering the "No Spin Zone!"
On it.  OK, Karen, Ryan, Pam, center stage.  Pam, run a comb through your hair.
Don't get too excited, that's out of 20.  Right this way.  Regional Manager Michael Scott will be addressing the client in the press room shortly.  Have a seat, can I get you a beverage?Chad L

Emergency dentist appointment.
May I point out that the sex appeared to be consensual?  Both animals were smiling.
You would be on the ground, blind, deaf, dumb.
They would flank you.  Throw in a concussion grenade.
I'm just saying...
Uh, you could never withstand a SWAT team.
Ah-luh-luh, a little comment.  Muh.
I'm Jim Halpert.
Yeah, that's cause I'm... you're boyfriend, Jim Halpert.  Hey, Karen, wanna get t-together later and have sexual intercourse cause you're my girlfriend?
Pssssh.  I look like an idiot. Hey Karen.
...'cause there's no comeback for that.
Say you're sorry times infinity...
You're right. Mercy is for girl-babies. Time to put this dog down.
I don't know...
What's a dis... what's that?
That is correct.
Oh, it is serious. Five citations and you're looking at a violation. Four of those and you'll receive a verbal warning. Keep it up, and you're looking at a written warning. Two of those, that'll land you in a world of hurt... in the form of a disciplinary review written up by me and placed on the desk of my immediate superior.
Three demerits and you'll receive a citation.
Let's put it this way. You do not want to receive three of those.
You've gotta learn, Jim. You are second in command, but that does not put you above the law.
That is a demerit.
Look at that one.
There are several penises there I'd love Phyllis to run her eyes over. You know, see if we can catch this pervert.
Agreed. Let me show you what I've been working on.
Phyllis, sorry. I've got penises on the brain. Back to work, everybody.
Due to a recent incident involving Phyllis, a man, a map, and his penis - I think you know what I'm referring to - Michael has authorized me to form an emergency anti-flashing task force.
Those are collectible action figures and they're worth more than your car.
You know what? Why doesn't Oscar run the meeting? He's a homosexual.
Mm, less than three.
Yes. Did you hear that, Michael?
Desperate times call for desperate measures.
Attention. I am removing all bananas from the kitchen.
I wish I could menstruate.
Hmm, doesn't seem like the type.
Have you finished with the sketch?
More like, "Aye, aye, General."
No, duh. That's why we gotta catch him. Start hanging those.
Of course you do, moon face. That's because you're a preppy freak, you're the office pariah, and nobody likes you. So start hanging these all around the building.
You know, I may have underestimated you. You're not a total ass.
Yeah, I do. 'Cause justice never rests.
You have information about the sex predator?
Ugh. I'm hanging up.
Jim, what are you doing? I'm busy.
If you are trying to kiss my ass, I would not suggest it.  Believe me, you do not want to kiss this ass.
I got nothing cooking, it's cooked.  It's borscht and its served cold.
I will never be your vichyssoise.
"The uterus contracts after your egg passes through it."
No, that's not how it works. You have to point to a specific part of the body.
OK, where does it hurt?
I hope there will be management parables.
Yes! Funtivities! I knew it wasn't just a trip to the beach.
OK, seriously. You really shouldn't be saying that. M
He-who-must-not-be-named? I wouldn't do that.
Slytherin are the bad guys, Jim.
We will be called Gryffindor.
I am trying to bring team spirit.
OK, I apologize for yelling at you. R
If Michael organizes some kind of group hug, stand next to me.
Aaaagh! Uggggh! How do you like that?
No! It's okay. I will do this Michael. M
Please tell me. I've been so good...
I know, we're putting on a play for Japanese investors.
Is that a sumo suit?
If I guess, will you tell me?
Thank you, Michael. M
What did I say!?
No! Hey, hey, hey, hey!  Do not wish them luck.  Do not wish them luck.  All luck must be wished unto Michael.
Okay, also, moratorium on Cornell talk.  Don't wanna hear about it.  Forget your personal history, and learn the history of this company.
What is the capital of Maine?
Wrong.  Black.  It is the most dominant.  How do you make a table?
As if you had a choice.
My first order of b
Do you accept?
Mmmmmm, let's call it Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.
Correct, I need someone I can trust.  But I would also like the title... to be secretly applied to you.  Just stripped of its pomp and frills.
Well, in a sense.  Although, publicly I am going to retain the Assistant Regional Manager position.
I had to make Andy my number two.  It's political, complicated, you wouldn't understand.  I want you... to be Assistant Regional Manager.
Yes!  Michael is gone.  There's a new sheriff here in these offices, and his name is "me."  Conference room!  Ten seconds!  All of you!
Instead, today I will begin my first lecture in a long series of lectures designed to increase your knowledge on the world of paper.
Just... zip your lid!  Another announcement.  Michael wasted an enormous amount of the group's time and patience with non-work related ethnic celebrations and parades of soft-minded dogoodedness.  No longer.  No more meetings!
Excellent question, Pam.  1/100th of a cent.
Zip your lid!
No, no, no, wait!  Class is not canceled.
No wait, what are you doing?!
What's the ratio of Stanley Nickels to Schrute Bucks?
We--- Don't you wanna earn Schrute Bucks?
Then you have been deducted 50 Schrute Bucks!
Very good!  You have earned one Schrute Buck.
Soil. Right.  We have, in front of you here, seven different types of Pennsylvania top soil.  Now, what would you say... is the most important element in the production of above ground leafy growth?  Probably phosphorus, right?   Wrong!  It's nitrogen!  Absorb this information.  Good!  Now, let us discuss precipitation.  Stanley!  When rainfall occurs, does it usually fall in a liquid, solid, or gaseous... state?
Trees!  And where do trees grow?
It's so intimidating!  Anyone who comes in here... is gonna have to take me seriously.  Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!
It's like outerspace without the stars, it's so black.
It was Andy's idea.
To intimidate my subordinates.
I wanted to thank you... for helping me, when you held the title, Secret Assistant to the Regional Manager.  You served the office with great dignity.
Wrong.  It is a corporation formed by aliens.
Nyah ah! Too long!  What is the Dharma Initiative?
What is a scented candle?
When is the Paleolithic Age?
Step 5,  ...the wound.
Talk me through an appendectomy.
Inventor of the cotton gin.
No need we can just check the security tapes.
Did you get sick of that face? Did she owe you money? Uh-oh. Is this downsizing? Did she spurn your advances?
Was she talkin' back?
Hey... Why did you do it?
So what do you need me to do?
Check to see if she's faking. If a car hit me, it wouldn't crack my pelvis. You know what; I bet she cracked it at home. Jumped in front of the car to get some workers comp.
Hey monkey, what's up?
Actually the place that she's in is the freezer, because of the odor.
So... Hey come on, don't be sad, just... OK... just. She's in a better place.
Really dead. Like a... just a dead cat.
That was the sick one, right?
Sparkles, the white one, is dead.
Well you left the TV on, and your cat is dead.
I do not respect her, but I will go.
No, I have not.
Cats do not provide milk or wool or meat.
She's only a cat.
Just doing my job.
Pfft... Her chart doesn't indicate that she had a hysterectomy but she did, or at least she got time off for one.
Are you a doctor, or a male nurse?
Actually the doctor said it was lucky she came in to the hospital, cause the only way to beat rabies, is to start treatment before the symptoms set in... Lock jaw.
No, no. You've gotta be bitten by something.
You'll feel better after the 5k. Exercise is good for depression.
You're taking this out on me, but I was only the messenger.
Maybe we should just skip the ceremony and setup a college fund for Meredith's son.
Well I don't know, on the other hand it does leave less money for bat birth control.
On your marks, get set...
You've got nothing to worry about, I put Imodium in Toby's coffee before the race.
Or we can have her buried out at the east field, by mother. Huh, Angela?
I know a great taxidermist. I'll pay to have her stuffed. Well he's not great, but he's pretty good.
I thought I was helping you. I expected a hug. I took care of that cat, the best way I knew how.
It's fine. What?
It's nothing, I'm robbing her.
Hey, Oww!  It's OK.
Well I'm not responsible for that!
It was beautiful and gentle and respectful. I fed her antihistamines and she gradually fell asleep.
I... I sang her, her favorite songs.
OK, when a farmer sees an animal that is in pain, that has no quality of life, that has no utility, a farmer does what city folk don't have the stomach to do.
I am a farmer Angela.
Well you look cute as a button. You've worked up quite a sweat.
Garbage can be very helpful. OK, he's a youthful cat. He killed an entire family of raccoons.  Look at him.
You haven't buried her yet?
And his name is... Garbage. Mose calls him Garbage because he likes to eat garbage.
It's a feral barn cat. I trapped him last night and I'm giving him to you as a replacement cat for the one I destroyed.
To give you this .
What if we don't want to use a Blackberry because they are stupid and pointless?
I'll make a reservation. No, no. Let me cook for you. Cauliflower and noodles. Baked potato on the side.
Oh, yeah. Yes!Robert D
No, please don't do this, monkey.
Then don't look in my eyes. Look right here , it's an old sales trick.
Are you enjoying your mineral water?
Oh, that's funny.
Yes...  I miss you.
You're welcome. A
Plus a little extra. Also, I love you.
Fine.  Then I just want to be friends.
Please, let me go. I need to win those clients back.  Please.
Michael, wait. Let me go.
The government, spy satellites, private detectives... exgirlfriends.
Why do you use that thing? Let's them know where you are at all times.
Larry Myers. Left us six months ago for Office Depot.
Ah, that's a pain in the ass.
Remember what we had Larry?Larry M
Please, come back.
Yes, yes we know but we just have not gotten over you.
Ugh... no, she's wonderful... at accounting. But she drives me crazy.
Like Angela in accounting.
I don't know. Sometimes people are just impossible and they make you miserable.
That's not gonna change his mind. He's moving on. We had our chance and we killed it.
Accept it, why would he come back?
He's not coming back, it's over Michael.
You don't know?
I got you, I got you!
Remain calm! I have trained for this!  Michael! Michael!
No, it's--- there's no road here!
This is the lake!
It can't mean that! There's a lake there!
No no no, look, it means go up to the right, bare right, over the bridge and hook up with 307.
Wait wait wait! No no no! It means bear right, up there.
That's how it goes sometimes, you know? You lose everything and everything falls apart and eventually you die and no one remembers you.
Did you get the rental insurance? Because that is pretty important too at a time like this.
Take a stand!
Yes, we need a cab at Lake Scranton, at the end of East Mountain Road, in the lake.
Look at that, still works. Old fashioned cell phone.
I'll call a cab.
We'll bill you.
Excuse me I have an announcement to make. We seem to be missing a box of chocolate turtles with peacons, and we will not be leaving the premises until we obtain them. Hand. Over. The. Turtles. Now!Ex-
Nice leather, oh my shoes are so muddy! Ex-
Can you call us a cab please, I'm gonna  Oops, sorry!
It's real simple. If you don't appreciate what we do, then give us back our basket.Ex-
Vaccines are for chumps!
That's an excellent analogy.
They fall under the category of airplanes.
Printing press.  Tractor.  Mechanical thresher.  Telephone.  Airplane.  The only inventions that matter.
Yes, I did, but I do not intend to use it.  It is pointless technology.
Well I will prove you wrong.
You believe a computer can beat me?
I can make more sales than a computer.  In fact, I challenge that website to make more sales than me today.
Really?  'Cause Ryan says so?
That's ridiculous.  I'm not going to be beaten by a website.
Go to my car.  Open the trunk.  Inside you will see many pelts.  Under the smallest one is a case.  Inside that case is a bear horn.  Bring it to me.
I just feel like we need something more to acknowledge when I make a sale.
Just ignore him.
Hmm.  Very nice.  Very nice.
Three reams! Yoohoo... in your face, machines.
Today I'm prepared to give you 15% off our normal prices.
Uhyeaahhh!  Hello, Susan?  Dwight Schrute. J
Hey, you wanna win?  You gotta fuel like a winner.
Got it.  Carb up.
I do not look worried.DunMiff/
Y... You don't understand. If... okay, if this makes the difference, I'm gonna tell it that you were responsible.
Return it!  Return it now! D
Damnit Kelly!  It knows!  It knows what you did!  D
I'm sorry.  Am, so sorry.  I... yes.  Uh, could you repeat that?
Perfect.  So let me just get some basic information from you. Mmmhmm.DunMiff/
Did you see the board?
You didn't have to.
Hey.  So. What do you think?  I did it for you.
No no no the first part.
Reams. Wait. Say it. Say it again.  Announce it again.
Uh, she works in the annex.  You're also welcome to date Toby.
No.  I think you should date Kelly.
I think it's inappropriate to date someone you work with.
I hadn't noticed.
I think she's efficient.
I can make him talk, Michael.
What did you say?Pizza g
What did you just call him?Pizza g
We're a paper company.  The best paper company in the whole wide world.
It's just ice, it'll melt all over the floor.
If you're going number one you've got ten more seconds!
You had to, what other choice did you have?
Shut up, or I'm going to punch you in the throat!
I'm just scaring him.  The trick is to make him think you're going to do something to him.Pizza g
Alright.  Oh, I assume I'm going to be reimbursed for the pizzas.
Here we go, sixty-five.  You know what?  There's two more.
So, I'm paying full price?
What will you do?
Coopers has calamari.
Yeah, let's go.
I don't get that, I don't understand that.
Now I've got a beard, and I can do whatever I want, and I'm your boss.
I date Indian girls.
I started a fire with my cheese pita.
And I spent so much time in Scranton and I never sold any paper.
I was born a man, Halpert.
It's called being a man.  You should try it sometime.
It is not a B and B.
None of your business, Jim.
Schrute Farms, guten tag. How can I help you? Yes, we have availability on those nights. How many in your party? Oh no, I'm sorry, no king beds. No queen either. Well, we make our own mattresses that don't conform to the traditional sizes. Closest would be twin. Thank you so much for calling. Call back again. Aufedersein!
Where did you read that?
Okay, this is a mis-use of company phones. P
I'm not telling you anything.  Dwight Schrute, Dunder Mifflin.
We offer tours of the fields, and of the barn. Uh, perhaps you'll be interested in, um, Mose's table making demonstration?
You are incorrect. I was recently scrubbing my room of memories, and I didn't see it there.
You took that with you.
Mose, bags! Now!
No. Jim, come on.
I'll put you down for Irrigation. Well then, do you have any special needs or diertary restrictions?
American, Irrigation, and Night-Time.
Mose, what are you doing? No Mose! Put the--- Put the manure down! Put it down! Do not throw it! DO NOT THROW IT! Ow!
Oh. Well I'll look into that in the morning. Thank you for bringing that to the attention of the staff.
Is everything satisfactory with your stay?
Oh, Jim. I thought you were Mose.
Come in. Did you have another nightmare?
I am better than you have ever been or ever will be.
Maybe you should.  Whatever.
No you didn't.
I need help.
What is the matter with... me?
I was aware that you were speaking.
No,  I don't know.
Stay out of this, you!
Yes, I did, 'cept I don't think she means it.  Angela is in a great deal of pain because of the death of her cat, and she's in a kind of a grieving process, and it makes her say things.  So... best to just lay off.
That is impossible.  Unless you mean gonorrhea.
State your business!
Okay, go ahead, they're right.
Yeah, go ahead and stop.  You guys, you should really be looking, he's working his ass off over here.
Second Life is not a game. It is a multi-user virtual environment. It doesn't have points or scores, it doesn't have winners or losers.
Angela can stay the same, but we'll change Andy to Dwight.
We cannot talk about this... because, someone might hear us. A
Oh D. A
Oh D. A
We had already applauded.
I won't need to because we'll be together playing hooky.  Yeah.
I will know.
He looks like your twin.
Well, gee, Jim, I don't know, I guess there's no sales call today.
Egg dripping, blah, blah, blah.
Oh no, that is too bad.  Shoot.
No communication with the outside world Jim.
Come on, I already filled the bottles with the gas, it's going to be so badass.
Yeah, come on, it will be so badass.
Or real bombs.
I think I cut my penis on the lid!
Hey, you're making me spray!
Well you said that we couldn't make anymore stops, and I really had to go.
I'm peeing in this empty can.
Let's move! Move, move, move, move!
Then I'll grind up the jumbo chalk and blow it in his eyes.
And if we have to defend ourselves, I will stab the security guy in the eye with the jumbo chalk.
I have to do something to his eyes.
I can see the security guard's eyes.
There's a security guard coming by.  Hello, we're warehouse workers.  Would you like more proof?
I'm breathing heavily.
We are climbing some stairs.
Did you say Karen?
I'm losing control of my bladder.
Don't leave us, help us, we need help Jim!
Don't leave us!
My hip bone!
Do not tell Karen about the industrial copier.
Then we will burn Utica to the ground.
Listen lady, you can expect these kind of repercussions as long as you keep trying to poach our people.
Okay, that is so mean!  You know what, I'm not going.
Wait!  I wanted to sit next to you.   M
Yeah.  We shoulda brought Andy.  I cut a chunk out of my penis for nothing.
Pam is down for anything.
Do you want to do this right or not?
It would be better if you were unconscious.
What are you doing? M
And they would call me the Overkill Killer.
First, I would remove your teeth and cut off your fingertips so you could not be identified. M
Here's your knife. Here's your duct tape. M
I'm just --
I'm on it.
You wanted to see me?   M
Jim, Michael's office.
Tent, rainfly, gorp...
Anything else?  Flint...
Look at that.  Perfectly balanced.  This is a fine precision instrument.
All right! What is going on here?
I told you.
Wait a minute, Darryl is the client? ...No, no, no. He works here, dumbass.
Well, he has gone from completely hopeless to simply miserable.
Thank you Michael.
So can we come in?
We came here to eat dinner and to party, this is a dinner party right?
Hey hey hey hey.  I know you love beet salad. I've seen you eat it many times.
Angela, would you like some of my beet salad?
Fine. Get outta here.
Purely carnal and that's all you need to know.
I'm gonna take you home Michael.
You people.  Come on. You're sleeping with me. M
Michael can come home with me.
I wrote that. Michael, you shouldn't have to settle. This is my pledge to you. I will find her and I will bring her to you and as God as my witness, she shall bear your fruit. M
OK, I have collected the rest of the ladies.
Jim, how dare you.
Why don't you sit down? Michael... come on.  Here we go. Yeah. J
Come on. I'll drive.
I guess you could say she died of blunt force trauma and blood loss. She got in a car accident and plowed into the side of an airplane hanger. M
Rhythm and blues...
'You both kicked off your shoes. Those rhythm and blues...
We don't take debit cards, anyway.
Right.  Because you were in the America room.  In an election year.
You occupied the America room for six weeks.  That's our most popular room.
Your bill, minus the ten percent Dunder Mifflin corporate discount.
Okay, so look that over, make sure it's accurate.
You've got a ton of dandruff.
Wow! Lot of calories.
Taste good too.
Why am I being forced to come in tomorrow and pretend that a website made sales that I made?
No, singles only, singles only. Also three is unlucky. Curse of three.
Women look like white slaves.
Do you live in a regular sized house?
No, no, no. Not a wizard, a hobbit.
Hey, Dwight. You resemble a Tolkien character.
Do you have powers?
I'll order you some cranberry juice.
Maybe you have some kinda bladder infection.
You've already been several times.
They lay their eggs inside the unripe beet root, then come spring time the babies eat their way out.
Well it's weevil season but we were prepared.
Ok, wai, wai, wai, wait, wait.  You two, Jersey State girls, let's go.
How did you all find each other?
It's not safe. Anything could have been in there.  Nice try.
Wait, wait a minute, what's this, I didn't order this?
No, I have to go. Good luck against Conn College, alright?Tall Girl #1: Call me. D
I do, I have to go.
OK. Good night Ryan. 
I think his species might have a higher tolerance than ours. 
I got floor. 
I got sofa. I got sofa. 
It's dehydration.  He went to the bathroom at the club like fifteen times.
That'll come out of the upholstery. Oh, man.  He threw up in the back of the taxi.
Ohhh, man!   There it goes.
Friends with a hobbit.
Hazel.  They're hazel.
And... go.  Force it in as deep as you can.
Hold your breath.
Can you breathe?
Do it. Shake my hand. You will sell me this car. Shake my hand.
Do it now.
Say it. Do it. Now.
Now. Now. Now.
Five, four, three, two...
Seal the deal. Let's do it. Let's do this thing. Three, two, one--
You know what? You knock $1500 of the price right now, and I will take it off your hands. It's gotta be now.
Well, here are your o
This car's crap. I will buy it for next to nothing.
Uh, bumper's sagging.
So... All right, well, you're gonna have to deal with this yourself.
Say it. Just do it. Don't think, say it. Do it. Five, four, three, two... do it. Give me control. Michael... I promise to give authority back to you when this crisis is over. Do it, Michael. Do it. Hey, this office needs a strong man. Say it.
Just say it.
All you have to do it say it.
Well, there is the emergency disaster mode for the org chart. This gives me full authority over every single person in the office.
There is this yellow zigzag that does give Ryan the authority to discipline Stanley...
Yeah, well... seller beware. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got to monitor a three-way bidding war for my car on eBay.
It's my car now.
Maybe he's going to church. Or court.
I will tell on you.
Excuse me, people. It has come to my attention, some of you have forgotten, who is in charge here. When Michael is gone... Jim is in charge. When Jim is gone, Andy and I are in charge. When Andy is gone you answer to me. Okay?  He left. Last time I checked, the American workday ends at five pm. You will all stay at your desks until that time. Or, you will suffer the consequences.
So... what else is up?  Mich-
Michael, I know you're swamped. I just thought you should know that everyone in the office has left, except for Angela and I. Do not worry though, I have taken down their names, and I have docked them a personal day.
This man is an imposter! Do not do business with him! This is not Dwight Schrute!
Uh, uh, hang that up right now. Ha-
Jim, what are you doing?
Ugh! Okay, you know what? Fine. I will reprogram my phone to go to my office phone.  Done.
Disconnect that right now. You give me your earpiece.
No!  Pam, I'm over here!
Pam! You are not talking to Dwight right now. You are talking to Jim.
Woah, woah, woah, Pam!
But our, our elevator doesn't require a pa...
Would that be such a bad thing?
Because she... stinks... with her... ways... and her... head.
I hate her too.
So what do we know about her?
He's here on a special work program. He's slow, you know, in his brain.
Oh my gosh.
You made me wrap it. I thought it was over the line. I just-
Get it out. Come on, get it out. Get it out.
It's not rabid.
It was playful hazing.
N-no there's not.
N-nothing you need to know the details of.
Okay, here we go. Here we go.
Will you please?  Make a sandwich.  Now, according to my sources, you have an issue with the new H.R. woman.  Well, so do I.  And so does our secret benefactor.  That's too much peanut butter.  What I propose is a good old-fashioned hazing, and I need your help.  If you choose to accept this mission...Wipe the knife off before you stick it in the jelly.  Have you ever made a sandwich before?  Dammit, Meredith!
Really make one.
Yes, I do.
Can I get you a tankard of mead?
Welcome to our land.
Where is Ryan?
Maybe I do.  Enough of your magical riddles!
Troy, do you know anything about this?
From this point forward, you will not use the bathroom. We need to keep our starting weights high so we can lose more.
Michael, it's time.
There. Take those home to your wife.
No, no, no. This is your last meal. There will be no leftovers.
Wait a minute. Pam is on the scale.
Wait a minute. One more bite of eclair each. Hold it in your mouth if you can't swallow.
It's not gonna take her 10 minutes to fax it, Jim.  If I don't see you again, goodbye. Well, actually, I'll see you when you give me the fax confirmation, so never mind.
Let's do this thing.
OK, can you turn the girl off please? I'm trying to get some work done.
All right, we're set.
Not that guy who murdered his mother. He was not so handsome. Also Kevin.
Happy Birthday, Stanley!
This is what I'm gonna do.  I'm gonna randomly select three names and these three people will get liposuction.  Uhhhhh Stanley, Phyllis, Kevin.  And you will be responsible for your own medical bills.
I am hardly the problem, Jim.
But you know what, I want to make it up to you.  There is a sure fire sale, but it's a two man job.  Interested?
Yeah, I took your purse.  What are you worried about?    You look great.  I can definitely see the difference. P
And you burned over a thousand calories walking home.  And this branch just got a little bit closer to winning the contest.  Phyllis Vance, ladies and gentlemen!
Eh, I've been sitting all day.
No, no, no, it goes, it goes... look, "I say, I say, I say, I'll sit on you!"
I apologize for creating a ruse which forced you to exercise. M
She should thank me.
Ok, well played.  Neither of us'll write the other up for not working.
I'm gonna write you both up for not working.
What are you writing about me?
I do not!  I do not say "Hi" Pam!
Yes, you do.
Dripping on me.
What are you smiling about there smiley pants?  You're late.
Oh, you wish.  Hellboy's a hero.
Can you not?  No sitting devices, Michael's rules.
Careful.  Hmm.  She was a keeper.
Will you be able to milk with those implants?
She's not a virgin, you know.
Time thief.  Time thief!  Fire him!
It's a trick question.  The bread is poisoned.  Also, it's not your real family.  You've been cuckolded by a stronger, smarter male. A
What should we be working on while you guys are talking?
There is no way that that was---
Oh, so wait a minute, you're going to time me every time I yawn?  That's absurd.
What are you doing?
Yes, maybe I'm not.
None of your business.
My cervix is ripening.
Contractions are coming every ten minutes.
The pressure!  The pressure!
It's about adapting to the circumstances.
No, Gibson is covered in potholes.  Your car breaks down. Adapt!
Right. Highways or surface roads?
Aaaaaaaa! What do you do? What do you do?
Butter. Newborns are slippery.
OK!  When the baby emerges, mark it secretly in a kind of a mark that only you could recognize and no baby snatcher can ever copy.
Do you have the Sharpie?!
Do you have the Sharpie?!
No! I don't want natural!
Numb me up. I want anesthesia!
I'm screaming, I'm screaming, I'm screaming! Aaaaaaaa!
Cradle my head!
Who's Sarah Kayacombsen?
Huh. Twelve hundred dollars for a stroller? Phhhbt.
Oh.  I took the liberty of putting it in your trunk.
You set a date?
I know none of that. If I did, you'd be the last to know.
You got a better way?
That's really fattening.
Why is she marrying Andy?
I just don't get it.
I was talking to myself.
She introduced me to so many things. Pasteurized milk, sheets, monotheism, presents on your birthday, preventative medicine.
Bravo, Watson. Looks like a classic seven-man job. Okay, security tapes were stolen, Motives-financial, or possible, vintage HP computer collectors. Hank down at security had clocked out. And that's all we have.
Wait, this isn't our floor. Dwight...
Are you sure that's going to work?
I know she loves me, Phyllis. I am sure of it. She practically told me so.
I said I was only gonna say this once. You have until 6:14 PM. 6:14!
Hey Phyllis, someone let the air out of your tires. Come quick.
Oh. I get it. You're trying to secure your place as head of the party-planning committee. You're just being selfish.  And you slap like a girl.
Wait, that's it? That's your advice? I thought you had some kind of big master plan.
Okay, fine. I've moved on. Now how do I get her back?
Listen, she ignored my ultimatum. Now what?
Eh, it's not worth it.
700 and one penny.
500 and one penny.
400 and one penny.
350 and one penny.
300 and one penny.
I'll bring you one tomorrow.  You've earned it.    Mmm.  I hope you like fox meat.
I meant that as a compliment to you Phyllis, as well as a slight to Andy.
Well if somebody who barely out-sells Phyllis, can get in, I should be fine.
No I get it. I totally understand. And uh, I just want to assure you, that I mean no disrespect. You see, I'm applying!
Thought I'd go casual today. Morning everyone. Good morning.  Hello.  How are you Phyllis?
Someday, we'll both get together in Comstock Hall and just laugh about all of this.
Not so. Cornell is an excellent school. Without its agricultural program, we probably wouldn't have cabbage. At least not modern cabbage.
Andy, let's just talk about this man-to-man, after work.
That's a conflict of interest.
Andy, I've been meaning to ask you, which a cappella group should I join? The Harmoniacs, or the Do-Re-Mi-Go's?
That is all sir, you may go.
Will end completely!
And your affiliation with Cornell -
And you will not be pleased with the result.
-Cornell Application Department, A
And you will be hearing from the -
"Interviewer has suspect motives."
"Interviewer is threatening applicant with an arbitrary review process."
Well, when they get my evaluation we'll see if they're interested.
On the contrary, I'm helping Cornell. By evaluating their interviewers.
Hmm, interviewing skills, sub-par.
Dale Raymond Corson!
I see what you are doing. But I do not know where you are going with this.
Where did you get those?
No, but it'll make you respect him less.
You once told me that Andy and I had different strengths. Well, he can't do what I can do. I can get into Cornell, but he doesn't know how to make food and shelter from a golden retriever.
Oh, nothing can hurt you now. You're a man in love!
I heard someone got engaged, you dog, huh?
Impossible to say. I can't see myself.
No, but that's sometimes part of it.
Wait, is this a joke? I'm getting that queasy feeling that sometimes accompanies jokes.
I sell more paper than anyone.
What does it say?
Bring it on.
What do you think I am saying to you?!
I didn't say a
You're an idiot.
And I'm going to find that person and punish them.
I'm being sabotaged.
Those can't be my scores, Jim. For your information --
None of your business.
What are you mumbling about?
Don't do it, Michael.
You are the master.
I have to put you on with my boss.
Please give me another chance. Mr. Buttlicker.
Please, Mr. Buttlicker --
Buttlicker! Our prices have never been lower!
...never been lower!
OK, our prices have never been lower.
OK, as I was saying, right now we are having --
Sorry, Mr. Buttlicker. As I was saying, we're having a limited--
Oh, no. What's wrong?
What? No, but I --
Really, that's your real name?
What is your name, sir?
Excellent, then you are in luck, because we are having a limited-time offer only on everything.
Hello, this is Dwight Schrute from the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
All right, fine.  Brrring.
I don't know. Two, maybe three if one wears out. How many shoes do you need?
Could be the mob. But then Dunder-Mifflin would need to be a front for money laundering, and there's little evidence of that.
Who stands to benefit from our downfall?
You never know. Better safe than sorry.
They might be listening to u
Shh.  They might be listening to us.
She's not here, Jim.
Who are you talking to?
Well, stop. Hold your breath. I still hear it. Who's there? Kelly, is that you? Hold on.
Breathing. Is that you?
Shh. Do you hear that?
Wait, shut up.
The reason that I got bad customer reviews is because I didn't! There is a massive conspiracy going on here, and I know you're involved.
Of course I am. I know you're the mastermind, but you're too stupid to do it by yourself.
What are you up to, girl? Huh? Phyllis put you up to this? Stanley? Are they paying you?
I think you know.
Hear anything interesting?
I knew it the whole time, buddy!
I knew it.
I was right.
I was -- I was right.
Obviously. I knew it.
Oh, man, I knew it. Who are her co-conspirators?
No. Why? No.
I want to be here when you fire her ass.
We have our confession. I'm calling security.
Oh, come on. You juked the stats, cupcake.
Let me paint you a picture of a little girl from southern India, who despite being welcomed into this country will now spend the rest of her life in prison for a crime she did commit.
You already said deal.
While you, my good friend, have nothing more to worry about. This wedding is officially out of your hands.
Please feel free to call or stop by, any time of the day or night.
Well, then. Why don't you look over some of our materials?
There's no way you're laughing at this.
How is that funny? What are you really laughing at? Huh?
Are you laughing at me?
What we have come to know as fake crab meat is in fact real crab meat, and real crab meat is lobster.
Jesus had a daughter, and she was the Mona Lisa.
Battlestar Galactica isn't a documentary exactly. D
The Scranton Zoning Board has a strong bias against beet farmers. The mayor is in the pocket of Big Lettuce.
Do you want to get robbed in a foreign country? I wash my hands of this.
Here, let me help you.
No, no, no, no, no.  You want to wear that puppy right up on the breastbone like a bra.
Do you have your money belt?
Wait, why do you need three suitcases?
Who is that monkey?
It's totally unrealistic.  There are no lines in the parking lot.
Last I checked, that's not an office building in the Andromeda galaxy.
What? Are there two suns?
Have you seen her painting, Jim? The building? There are shadows coming from two different directions.
Oh, well, doesn't surprise me.
Alright. First thing in the morning then.
Good. I need you to make five copies of these.
To socialize.  And inform.
Brownies is it? Hm. Pastry cubes made of sugar and fat? No thank you, I'll stick with my jerkie.
He looks great.
Also, it's icky back there.
Men find me desirable.
Oh, it's a good day too. I'm wearing my mustard shirt.
Men find me desirable.
I am the bait.
I love catching people in the act.  That's why I always whip open doors.
Okay, fireable offenses i
Are you really not going to punch him?
Punch him as hard as you possibly can in the face.
Ryan.  Come on, man?
Hit him!  Hit him, Chicken.
Come on.  Baaah!
I hope he doesn't haul off and just hit you.
Those are fighting words.
Oh I've framed animals before.  I framed a raccoon for opening a Christmas present.  And I framed a bear for eating out of the garbage.
Yeah, it's illegal, but... everything they do on The Shield is illegal.
Frame him, for using drugs. M
There's still one thing we could do to get Toby fired.
Hey, Pam. Hey I got this, okay?  Hello, officers, Dwight Schrute, former volunteer Sheriff's Deputy.  Listen, I may have inside information that someone is hiding drugs in this very office.
You have laws that protect you in any kind of interrogation.  Why don't you use them?
Wait, officers, are you sure you don't want to interrogate him?
Gahh, dammit!  Come on!
So wait a minute, there's no drugs?
No! Michael, no!
Save your whining for the jury there, Flenderson.
They don't need your permission, Flenderson, they've got the company's permission.
Search his things.
Officers, I reveal to you the perpetrator.
Well we're not gonna put out stumps, come on.
We'll dig a trench. As long as it's downhill from the well, we should be fine.
How could it be more clear?
Yeah, do tell.
There's a hose out back.
...I'll consider it.
You wanna eat, don't you?
Manure covers up the small of the slaughterhouse.
You're gonna need to be more specific.
Cow, goat or sheep.
It doesn't make any sense.
Cats don't make butter.
Okay. Cow, goat or sheep. It's not that hard.
And there we go. Okay, and that's just about it. Man and wife.
Although born just minutes from here, he speaks only German. Closed society. So, now, after the readings by all of your sisters, we will arrive at the vows. So, Konrad...  And then he's going to ask Angela if she would like to marry Andy, to which you will reply...
He doesn't understand a word you're saying.
So... why don't we try this out, we'll see what would happen. Give it a little test drive, what do you say? You pretend to be Angela's father, you will play Angela, and uh, I will pretend to be you. That way you can see what it looks like when you're up here.
My... It's not my fault you don't understand German; I've been telling you to take it for years!
Haha, Mrs. Schrute.
It does in the state of Pennsylvania.
Yes, of course it does.
Well Monkey, he's a real minister. And you said, "I do." And I said, "I do." And Andy wasn't signing a receipt; he was signing our marriage certificate as a witness.
I know you did. And that's why I have taken care of everything.
Really? If I can skin a mule deer in less than ten minutes, I ought to be able to cut my --
Yeah, no such thing.  They don't give out black belts for things that are stupid.   Well, I hope it was worth it, cause I'm gonna take it apart in about five minutes.
You're so pathetic.  How long did this take you? Three hours?
These are not dolls, Jim.  These are commodities.  Same as gold or oil.
They are now.
Oh, so glad I could help.
We got a live one!  On fire!!
No, I like Meredith.
I stab her in the brain with a wooden stick.
Oh right, that'll take a couple of weeks.
I suppose I could do it if it was a controlled burn in a well ventilated area.
She is a hazard to the other people of the office.
Oh, as fire marshal I would have to.
Not my problem.
Oh, that's my last one.
Well don't look so surprised.
I was just jogging.
Seems like you already know where.
No. You can't do that. It shouldn't come from you.
Wait, what?  You can't take what?
I need a soup spoon.
I've got a better angle on Pam. I can see everything.
Trade seats with me.
Because you're engaged to Andy.
Do you love me or not?
Get it over with. Then we don't have to hide anymore.
You've got to tell Andy about us.
Have a good trip.
Might get ugly.
Michael, once this gets out... I don't know how it's going to go down.
I don't know.
Angela said she was going to tell him. She's just not ready.
If I'm sitting, I don't have the option to.
If I'm sitting, I can't disable his neck or his groin.
That is stupid. I will use a sword and I will cut off your bare hands.
None of your business then.  Good. So what weapon?
Outside of work.
Hey, this is none of your business.
What is your weapon?
Okay, fine! Good! A duel! The winner gets Angela.
That is very general, and does not scare me in the slightest.
Oh really? How are you gonna do that?
And I'm telling you that I will never back down.
I don't think so.
Will never be her name.
Well I don't know about that, because she certainly seems to enjoy making lovemaking with me.
No I don't.
Uh, no way. I am not giving up.
Oh good. She broke up with you.
I will also be talking my break at the exact same time and in the same location.
How'd that get there?
Come on, coward! Where are you? Where...
Where are you?
Alas, after much consideration and deliberation...
She said she was only sleeping with me.
She's sleeping with you?
Sasquatches are the strongest animal on the planet! So fine, call me a Sasquatch!
Yeah, back off. This isn't your fight. Oh, how much is this gonna cost?
No. My right one's falling asleep a little bit.
Last year, idiot!
You're not a man! You don't know how to take care of her!  "La la la la la la la la la la!" What does that mean? You can't even protect her!
Never!  Get out and face me like a man!
Come on! Ow! Ah! Aah!
Hmm. It wasn't here before. J
I'll have a cup of a coffee.
You know how I feel about IHOP.
...and then we compare notes.
Then we meet at the Denny's...
I am a paper salesman looking for a new job. I find out everything about their expenses and salaries.
Okay, let's go over the plan again.
You'll fall in love with her.  M
Please Michael, please.
No, I wanna seduce her.
So you go in now, I am going to go in exactly ten minutes. We have never met each other. We are complete strangers. Also, we are going to need a signal to bolt out of there if there is danger. Lick ur lips, try it.  Good. M
Get your clouds right.
Oh, it would if they were all cumulous and not cirrostratus.
Which Means they're not acquiring new business. So once again no growth.
No because their sign is centered perfectly above their store. No sign of the sign being moved.
It means they are not expanding.
Pshaw, that's nothing. I've 90 clients myself. You had better look out, someone might run you out of business.Prince G
I'm your son now; you can visit him on holidays. Dwight Schrute, I'm a paper salesman at a second tier paper company called Dunder Mifflin.  I'm the top salesman there and I'm looking for a new challenge. I would say you guys have what, 40 high full volume clients?
Why don't you just get rid of this guy? Prince G
It's going very well.
That's not good.
You drove over that. Go back
Someone's looking out the window. Go go, Peel out, go.
All their top clients I can't believe it.
Thank you for your time I look forward to getting your calls. Prince G
Thank you very much. M
Excuse me sir, I took the bus here and was wondering if I could catch a ride home with you in your car.
He drove over the divider and then backed over it and caused the..Prince G
You've done more then you can possibly know.
Oh man, M
Goodbye prince family,  Bye bye.
I look forward to hearing from you about that job application.
This is disgusting, what is it this, instant?Prince G
Yeah, save your heart for love, and use your brain for business, right? If we don't do this to prince paper, someone else will. Worse yet, someone else will do it to us.
Your heart is a wonderful thing, Michael. But it has made some terrible decisions.
Michael, you have to. Have you ever seen a lioness devour its cub? Have you ever seen a baboon devour its mate?  Have you ever seen a raccoon devour a squirrel?
It doesn't make sense, of course I'm alive.
I'm not familiar with that expression,
Its simple, David would use that information to destroy them.
Its business, not personal.
No no no, I can't let you do this!
Freeze, give me the list!
Michael, Michael, no. Michael, give that. Michael, don't do this. No.  M
Where are you taking the client list?
Good, so,  where are you going?
Fire not real.  This was merely a training exercise.   Oh come on.  It's not real Stanley. Don't have a heart attack.
Attention everyone! Employees of Dunder Mifflin!  This has been a test of our emergency preparedness.  There is no fire.  It was only a simulation.
How about 911?  Anyone? 911.
What's next? A
A what?  A rag.  A damp rag, perhaps.  Let's remember those procedures.  What are the options?  Okay, that's the wrong way.  We've already tried that.  Remember your exit points.  Exit points people.
Okay! Procedure, procedure. Exit options.  Where do we go folks?  Wha-- Use a what to cover the mouth?  A
Have you ever seen a burn victim?
Okay, let's go. E
Things can be replaced, Phyllis! People, human lives, however, can... O
Back to our options. Jeez! Ok! settle down everyone.  No bunching!
Well, uh, another option.  J
Oh! Here's a door.  Check that one out. How's the handle?
Okay, what's next?
Not a viable option.
No! No, Michael! No!  Touch the handle.  If it's hot, there could be a fire in the hallway.
Wait, wait, wait.
No, we don't know that.  The smoke could be coming through an air duct.
Oh, how did that happen?
Oh, fire!  Oh my goodness!  What's the procedure?  What do we do, people?
Hee-heeding this right now.
N-no one would take hedded of my instructions.
Yes I shouted "fire!".  I shouted many things! I also shouted instructions on how to get out of the building, so you can imagine my frustration as safety officer when nobody would heed of what-- heeded--
I just want to say for the record, I did not kill anyone.  Stanley was attacked by his own heart. And he should be released from the hospital and back in the office in a couple days. L
A lot of ideas were not appreciated in their time.
I am planning a bomb scare that should really get the blood pumping. M
Don't you worry about that.  I got it covered.  Okay?
This is a farce. I should be teaching this course.
Absolutely I would not.
We search for the organs. Where's the heart? The precious heart.
Get me some ice and a styrofoam bucket.  Here we go.
Wrong. Ehh. Check for an organ donor card.  If he has one, we only have minutes to harvest. C
Okay, he's dead.  Anyone know what we do next? Anybody? Rose? R
I didn't think it was very realistic in the movie and it turns out, it's pretty realistic.David W
Yeah, right. I filled him full of butter and sugar for 50 years and forced him not to exercise. Now, take a lesson from Stanley and jog on up here and sign this, okay?  Make a line. Just form a line right here.  Sign it!  Sign it now!
I could not, because I do not feel it. Okay, everyone. I am going to need you to sign this statement of regret as an acknowledgement that you heard it.  Okay? Everyone come on up here. It's not a big deal.
"I state my regret."
Nothing stresses me out. Except having to seek the approval of my inferiors.
That was the last signature I needed.
Are you calling me an idiot?
You're interrupting me. I'm trying to get your back.
Ok, no, they don't understand who they have...
Okay, you should be bowing down in front of him.
Michael is your superior.
Oh, that's quite a leap Pam.
Attention everyone I just got a text from Michael. He says personnel day. Are we hiring?
Hey. Why are you wearing a turtleneck?
Excuse me, that is no way to address a superior.
That's on my side.
...there was a problem with having one head of the party planning committee. She becomes too powerful, so he appointed two heads.
What he said was...
Go ahead, you do it.
What kind of cake do you want imbecile.
If you say screw you one more time...
That's how much you and I contributed! I... Damn it Jim!
How much do you have?
Have you collected the money from everyone?
Are you trying to hurt my feeling? Because if so, you are succeeding. Fortunately, my feelings regenerate at twice the speed of a normal man's.
This is more professional. It's not like she discovered a cure for cancer.
It's a statement of fact.
They match the c
Well, I'm not done yet.
Uh, 24. 37.
Mose doesn't know how to use a phone. So joke's on you.
Who is this?
I thought you said yesterday was your birthday!
Juvie... nile... Detention Center. Where they send teenagers!
Why don't you tell Jim where you were from ages 14 to 15.
What did you learn in there? I bet you learned things, huh? Like how to fashion a shiv, hmm?
What did you do?
Nice job on the cake, Bozo!
It's not effeminate. It's festive.
You know what? I'm a little busy.
Oh, my God. Is this how you are with Pam? 'Cause she must want to shoot herself in the face.
That's cool. Hey, you know what's even cooler than triceratops? Every other dinosaur that ever existed.
Schrutes don't celebrate birthdays, idiot. It started as a Depression-era practicality, and then moved on to an awesome tradition that I look forward to every year.  What about you?
Here's one. It was dark, warm, wet. A sudden burst of light. An intense pressure like I'd never felt before. Father, dressed in white, pulls me forward. Mother bites the cord.
You're right, forget horse hunting. It's stupid.
It's in the name.
Move it! Let's go, go, go, go, go. I got this.
Okay, nap it is! Everyone out! Get out! We're gonna be eating cake at our desks. Let's go. M
Oh, yes! Okay, good. So what's it gonna be, Kapoor?
That's our theme.
Our theme, if you will.
Hey, it's not a surprise.
Ayyyy!Jim, Pam, Michael and D
Yeah, deal with it Pam!
How about now?
Lonely people mixing with one another?  Breeding? Creating an even lonelier generation?  Ha, you're not allowing natural selection to do its work.  Pssh.  You're like the guy who invented the seat belt.
Oh God, that's a terrible idea.
What do you have in mind?
A net? a giant net?
You're right.  OK everyone,  back to work.
Hey.  No movement.
You must use a lot of paper.
You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  In fact, there are many knots that I cannot untie.  So where does a woman as charming as yourself find herself employed on a day such as today.
Oh, not likely.  3 billion woman on the planet, most of them live in Asia so the numbers just don't add up.
Hey, it just takes one!
Is somebody after you?
OK.  Well, thanks for wasting my time tonight, idiot.  God!
Oh-oh-oh before you go, I'd just love to get a firm commitment on this.  You know maybe sign--
OK, what's up?
Hey! Hey! Stop it! Stop it!
What are you doing? M
We will ask the questions!
OK, Michael, please, please, please, please, please let me.
I got a knock-knock joke. M
Had conversation with Michael about taking credit for an idea that wasn't mine. Discussed movies. M
I wasn't given candy as a child, so a movie that fetish-ized it that much, would have made no sense to me. Plus, we weren't allowed to see movies. So... do the math. M
To keep secrets from my computer. M
You don't keep a diary.
That was your idea. M
Oh, not gonna happen.
OK, what am I thinking right now?
What about Shoe La La?
No plowing my own acres. Going around shirtless all day. You know experiencing freedom.
He said he would do the same for me. J
David... you're welcome.
You never know when it's gonna strike. Just... boom. M
That's what she said!
Oh give me a break.
A canoe built around your horse so you can go from riding to water travel without slowing down. Horse Boat!
It is my idea.
That is my idea.  D
No, Michael. M
How about 5:15? J
Michael, you're just agreeing with him because he's wearing a tux. Don't you see what he's doing here?
Jim! Enough with the classy, ok?
Followed by a fifteen minute moment of silence.
I said that!
Ok, how about this? An ice sculpture, shaped like you, covered in chocolate-covered strawberries.
He is a regular peanut. He just happens to have a cane, a monocle and a top hat.
Mr. Peanut is not classy.
We'll finish it up later, but essentially what we're talking about is...
What about your party? M
He hung up?
No the other thing.
Good. Listen, my name is, uh, Michael... Scotch. And, uh, I just wanted to say that, uh, I've got David Wallace's son in the trunk of my car. If he doesn't get on this phone in 5 seconds-
How's it hanging?
Hey there, gorgeous. How you doing today?
Oh, Michael, come on, no. You have to charm 'em.
Any really good headhunter would storm your village at sunset with overwhelming force and cut off your head with a ceremonial knife,
Deutsch... let me see here.  That is either an incense dispenser, or a ceremonial sarcophagus.  P
Typical American ignorance that got us involved in a war we never should have been in.  World War II.
You know, I would love to put a pin in that.
Okay. So yeah.
Location is hard for me, with the farm and the responsibilities... M
What a courageous venture.
Way to go.
If you want to tell me -
This is how I breathe.
Jim, what do you say?
Great ideas are just part of what I bring to the table. J
Maybe you will tonight after work. What do you say?
Maybe you and Charles should kick the soccer ball around.
You can be so modest sometimes.
Really, Jim? I had no idea you played soccer. 'Cause you never, ever talk about it. J
Yeah, Jim. Why would an experienced soccer player like yourself duck at the very last moment?
Let me check.  Oh nope! Clearly a hunter. Who knows how to throw an outfit together.
Just kidding. You finding everything okay?
That could be Haddie. Begging for her life. And it could mean, that you're next.
It was gruesome. They say she walks these hallways. If you ever feel a tapping on your shoulder?
Yeah isn't it? She was bludgeoned to death by the business end of a riding crop.
Oh, this whole place used to be a brothel. There was a tavern on the ground floor.
A woman was murdered on this very floor in 1816. Haddie McGonagle. She was a prostitute.
You know there's a ghost in this o
Look I just want you and I to hang out so, you know. Just,  Boom.
And I, yours. So I will cede her to you.
Well, a little bit of blood rushed into mine as well, so where does that leave us?
Listen, when I saw you talking to Erin earlier, I noticed that your pupils dilated, and your skin flushed, and I'm assuming, a little bit of blood rushed into your penis.
Take it Andy! Take me home, to the place I belong, Ba bah dah d

Hey you want to sing with me? Almost heaven... Dwight and E
Oh it's good, you're coming along. It's really technically proficient but really there's no heart or soul in it.
Rebel Yell, Billy I
Enter Sandman, Metallica.
Cherry Pie, Warrant.
'Kay, thank you. It's a straight jacket!  Okay.
Doesn't Charles know he's compromising my attack readiness? It's not a dress code. It's a death sentence.
These sleeves are cutting off my circulation. Not enough blood getting to my hands.
But don't forget you owe me $10.
Michael, you know I can't take this.
Wh-  I don't need $6 to help a friend.
Thanks, Michael.  Wait, what is this?
It's small, I know.
They have some great kitchen ideas.
Hey. Ed's Tires is thinking of making a change.
Like a wolf. Thank you.
Your concern is noted.
Do you mean compared to the ways things ran with other bosses? Comparisons are hard.
I prefer to stand. Less blood clots.
I've said too much.
I'm not a barbarian.
It is the situation that we are in now.
It is possible that I could be talking about us.
Imagine... Someone has a personal hero they really wanna help. But then there's this new guy. Very cool, very Will Smith-esque, who would not like it if he helped his hero.
No, Mose is fine. I roped it off. It's not about Mose. Listen, things are changing here, Michael, they're changing fast. M
I don't know that I can do that now. You know, uh, something's come up.
I did, Michael.  I was upset about the shirt sleeves at first, but now I'm okay with it. C
I'm sorry, M
I think you have the wrong number, Michael.
And you have bad skin. Oh, look everyone, we're all making observations!
I have a long term relationship with Harper Collins publishers and Mr. Schofield. I'm not worried.
At what time?
In which direction?
Meet me in our spot in four minutes. M
I would like to arrange a truce.
I had fish yesterday.
Let me take you and your whole company out for lunch at Alfredo's. M
I want a truce.
And not come through for you? M
You were making me do things that were not all right.
Ok, I will see you very soon, alright?  M
He's technically fine. I imagine the true horror will be when he wakes up in a zoo.  Hey, listen, will you do me a favor and order the meatball parm for me, with extra cheese? M
I hit a bear. M
Oh, hi, Michael. I'm so sorry I'm late. I got stuck in traffic.
And I knew that you would do that. The meatball parm is their worst sandwich!
You think this is some kind of game? No, this is a war, and I will not stop, I will not rest. You have no idea what kind of enemy you've created. You have unleashed the wolf!
I broke it.
No, Michael, you were sabotaged.
Did you enjoy your lunch?
Don't let him in! He's a traitor! Michael!
Oh, no. No. No. No. No.
Sure. That'd be fine.
Are you saying you invented paper?
Thank you, Mr. Schofield, for your time. Much appreciated. Oh, and tell me, um, how's your gay son?Mr. S
What he's not telling you is that he will abandon you.Mr. S
La la la! Continuing.  Notice my persistence and recall. Continuing! You called Dunder Mifflin, and your order was filled within an hour!
I barge because I care. April 13th, 2002, that is the date when you tried to switch paper providers for an obscure sociology textbook, but were hung out to dry when the price of glossy stock increased.Mr. S
Ha ha! April 13th, 2002.Mr. S
It's not the soil! It's the manure! Paper is the manure! On-time delivery is the soil! Aah!
Shame, Jim.  I expected more.
Been there, done that.
It's not your fault. Some people just don't want to be inspired.
David Wallace! Hello, we've been expecting you, David Wallace.  Charles and I were waiting for you.
Come along, afterthought.
Five minutes exactly.
I say we fill Michael's office with bees.  My apiarist owes me a favor.  J
Stupid.  Yeah, makes us look weak.
Idiot, we're starting back up.  This is Dwight, by the way.
You know what?  Why don't I do it, okay? Michael adores me.  I'm the man for this job.  Charles, you got my back on this?
Oh, Man!  If only Michael had children.  That's how you really apply the pressure.  C
There is a hive of bees outside the front door.  We kidnap the queen, extract her alarm pheromones, place them on a flushable wipe, put that in his bathroom.
Let me float something out there, okay?  Can I just say-- can I say something?  D
I'm not-- I'm not following you.
I'm gonna answer Charles first.
You don't crack a case.  That has pejorative connotation.  That's like calling a policeman a cop.  You solve a case, and yes, I've solved plenty.  C
They've been calling all of their clients and begging them to pay more money.  That can only mean one thing.  They're desperate.  Which can only mean one thing.  They're total failures.
You were bought out.  So the company then bought out all of the stolen clients. M
Trust me, Stanley,  you're going to want to read this memo very carefully.  S
Did you even read the memo?  A
Okay, what are you still doing at your desk?
No, I'm not saying we do those things.  I'm saying something like those things.  J
Get out!  We need to do something.  I'm thinking maybe a coup or we take Ryan hostage.  P
No, you're too close.
And you're a temp and I'm taking your phone.   I'm confiscating this.
You're a secretary! What do you know?  R
Ah! Mr. Bart!  Ugh! [slams phone down[ I cannot believe you lost that account.  He was my client for ten years!
Hey, it's Dwight here.  Give me the phone.  R
Hi, Mr. Bart.  R
Give me the phone.
I'll do the best I can.
I don't know that first things about secret meetings.   M
Gasp.  Are you talking about a secret meeting?
Listen up, Flenderson.  You're being weak and ineffectual.  I'm cowboying this meeting, okay?  Here are the new rules.  Earth tones only.  Also, women are forbidden to wear pants.
It is a big deal. Cause there's only a handful of reasons why someone would ever go to a courthouse in Ohio and not be charged with a crime. To claim an inheritance from a deceased relative. To obtain a learner's permit at age 14 and a half instead of 15. Erin, let me see your birth certificate.
Attention, office. Who here is planning a trip to Youngstown, Ohio? I will take your silence to mean that you are all hiding something. This location is the Superior Court - P
Now, how can I help you?
Erin, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not necessary for you to ask us how we are doing every time you interact with us.
All work and no play makes Michael a dull boy.
Who tipped you over? Was it Phillip?
Hey! Hey, hey, hey! I got your text. Who's Phillip?
What do you think history is?
Yeah. Back injuries are common. Not as common as knee injuries but more common than wrist injuries.
I'm gonna need two able bodied men.
You want to get sick you go to the hospital.
Out of the way! Move it or lose it!
Come on. Relax. The shirt wasn't doing you any favors. If my assessment in correct, you grind your teeth?
Oh yeah. you've got a knot in your crest. This remedy has been passed down in my family for generations. and it always works. My grandfather was told that Diamond Dancer would never race again. they were wrong. He came in 9th in the Apple Creek Derby and his jerky came in 3rd the following year. A majestic beast. So fast. So tender.
Tell me where it hurts.
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, girl. Whoa. Whoa.
What's so funny?
No. Please. I find the rattle soothing. It puts me to sleep.

Ordinarily I would say no but you need to move to reduce lactic acid build-up. Also, this song is fantastic.Bob V
Oh yeah? Big deal. I once hit three home runs against Little Flower Catholic.
What do you need from me?
Bye Michael!  Yeah!
Of course. You think the EPA would ever allow that much DEET?
Good point, but, thought of that already. Combination SPF/repellent.
Come on, folks!
I'll tell you what, I'm gonna do you one better. I'm gonna put you next to Phyllis. She is the best setter on the team.
Woah, woah, woah. W-w-wait a minute. I get it. You want her to set you up so you can spike it.
Why? I don't understand.
Erin, back row. Ryan, you move up a row!
It's not a sledgehammer! Come on, people! We need to get our heads in the game! Let's focus! Come on, you're better than this! I am better than this! Phyllis, why are you sitting on the ground?!
I could've gotten that, idiot!
Ohh! Oh, Kevin! Come on!
Rule violation. Ball is ours. Give it to me. Our point. Okay. Hey, Pam, how ya doin? Hey, do you know if you're right-handed or left-handed? Or do you even know? What hand do you use to answer the phone?
Yes! We advance to the next round!
You weren't even moving.  Okay, sub!
Don't set it to yourself!
Okay, Rolph! Woah. Wait, wait-
Because if we don't play, then the other team wins.
Hey, people need volleyball now more than ever.
Rolph, leave it alone!
Rolph, please. I am asking nicely-
Okay, knock it off, Rolph.
Oh man, I am so mad that Pam got hurt! Argh!! Rrrraah!!!
Tell you what. I spotted a small hospital a few kilometers south of here. Get her back as soon as possible. I'll stall 'em.
Seven? Can I finish please?
No, no, hear me out. Five? Six?
Except, you know what? It's not fine. How many people need to get hurt before we learn a valuable lesson? One? Two? Three? Four?
Let's do it!
Okay.Andy & M
Yeah!  Parkour! Parkour!

Okay, what is it, what can't I guess?
He most definitely does. He's been asking her out repeatedly for weeks. She finally said yes. They went out on a group date the other night; apparently it went very well.
Okay, let me finish this thought.
Stanley's way past the middle of his life. Especially considering his height to weight ratio.
Look at the intern to your left. Now to your right.  will make a great mother. It's up to you to choose which you want to be.
Well now you can't call me at all. Problem solved.
Present these to the dean for credit. And, as a gift, I've attached my card. Call me any time of the day or night.
Who's the father?
It just doesn't add up.
Please... and how many foremen do you know that pull boxes?  T
Oh? From who, Dr. J?  Look, you really need to investigate this.  People don't just fall off of ladders.  T
So long Darryl, feel better...  He's lying.
Oh really, I'm sorry I thought this was a free country.  I didn't know we were in communist Sweden.  D
Hmmm, interesting.  How did the ladder end up on top of you, if you fell off of it?  D
Ooohhh...   Oh man!  You okay?  T
Oh, worker's comp, my ass!
Here, get down! He's not using crutches!  Get the camera!  T
I'm rebuilding a turn of the century steam engine in my slaughter house.  T
Nah, that's a GE. A P40 is much higher pitched.  T
Are you... are you serious?  Be... cause you look exactly alike.  Am I the only one?  Are you getting this?
He broke his ankle climbing over the railing and he lied about it because it was a misuse of company equipment, case closed.  D
Wait!  They're using the lift as their own personal elevator.
This has to do--
No, that is huge.
Jim won't sign my expense report.
I would like to file a huge, enormous, massive complaint about the tallest guy in our office.
I'm not cr-- uhh!
Wait, stop writing that. That is not true.
One minute ago.
What about all these people, huh?! How is it fair to them?!
This is ridiculous! How could he do this to us?!
I think it was Creed. C
Things were not this bad when just Michael was manager. M
Oh, gee, I'm sorry. I guess I missed the meeting where we all all voted for you to get pregnant. No! I reserve the right to peel my hard-boiled eggs at my desk.
It's easy. That's what I'm saying.
But you can say that about anything.
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.
Well, if this is in fact her because it is a very common name.
She had a couple hundred dollars to spend, I mean, if she was able to sell her bike.
Well... she was really into mountain biking but not so much lately.
Two years ago she was selling a mountain bike.
For instance, Pam's cousin, Jocelyn Webster.
Yeah. It's practical.
You're gonna like this.
This is to play when you bring a woman back to your hotel room.
You know what? I made you a cd...
What? No way!
No you do not.
Ok. Ok. A-ha-ha!  That was a test. You have failed. For this is my room. You would not share with me.
Oh no. Now that I don't have a room, can I stay with you?
Wait a second. Oh. No, no, no. This must be some kind of mistake. This reservation seems to be under an M. Scott. This must be yours.
No way. What if I meet someone?
Ok.Front Desk C

The proximity to the falls makes everything smell like a basement.
That's right. It is ew. It is very ew.
Excellent question. Because while I was busy trying to improve the company and make it a success, Jim... the bad man was busy kissing the boss man's butt.
That's a very good record.
Isabel Poreba. Oh, I've got stuff on her.  In 1996 her tenth grade volleyball team went 10-2.
It's just for family.
No. They're howling at the moon. It's suggestive to women because of the howling during sex.
What? It's a casual, social outfit.
Nine and three-quarters.
I found twins.
Drop this one. Abort.
I love finding a good set of twins.
"Jim... hey why don't you braid my hair.  I want to watch TV."
You'll have Pam to answer to.
Oh my goodness.
Really?  I hadn't noticed.  Too busy knocking boots.
You know it.
It really is.  I'm not hungry.  I ate a whole bunch of sunflower seeds after you went to sleep.  And besides, I wouldn't want to take you away from Pam on the morning of her wedding.  She needs you Isabel.  I
You should ask her out.  M
Oh please.  Put a gun in my mouth.
Brides side or grooms side?  Or townie?
Hey, what was she like?
I'm ravenous after a night of love making.  You?
So, uh tell me again the difference between Filene's and Filene's basement.  M
Oh.  Fine.  Isabel,  nice to see you.  What do you want?  I
Come here you.
I'd like to lodge a formal complaint against Jim for making us wait for over an hour.
I think you're right. It definitely looks suspicious. And his southern Italian heritage raises some flags.
No, not that, by itself. But look at all the facts. He seems like a mobster.
I knew it! More trunk space. Or should I say, corpse space.
Did he threaten you?
Lock your door!
No I disagree. "R" is among the most menacing of sounds. That's why they call it "murder." And not "muck-duck."
Let him know you're not the typical kind of guy that he can shake down. That you're stubborn. That you might even be a little bit dangerous.
Here's what we do. We meet him in a public place. Ask him to lunch or something like that, some place he can't be openly violent. A
No, criminals are like raccoons. Okay, you give 'em a taste of cat food pretty soon they'll be back for the whole cat.
That's an exaggeration.
You know what?
He's right. Cops can't do anything until a crime has been reported.
You're wearing loafers!
You'll never kill it that way. You want to separate the head from the thorax-
Hey. Bathroom checks out clean. Nothing behind the toilet except for this roach motel.
Bring him the gabba-gool!
What he's trying to say is, Gabba. Gool.
Oh he's not that nice.
Check out Dental?
So we're choosing...
He was trying to force you to decide on a policy.
Don't do it!
It means like this.
Do you know what "snap decision" means?
Well more far-fetched than a mobster walking into a paper company for a low-level shakedown?  And that happened.
What is wrong with you? I am talking about convincing Michael that the guy's not mafia!
Me neither. Not the way things are now. But what if Michael felt no fear toward the mafia guy? A
Yes. He's got to stand up to this mafia guy.
Not the living in fear, that's new.
Not on the inside he's not. Look at his life! Broke! Living in fear! No friends, dead end job.
It's true, he's clean. I have a couple of friends still on the force. Checked with them. Ran his Fed friend up the flagpole to make sure he wasn't on the take. Turns out he's a totally lovely guy. Sweetest guy on the force really.
You successfully backed down the mob!
We just told you he wasn't mafia, so you wouldn't be scared.
That's good, let's wrap it up.
Its Jim and Pam, Michael.
Number one, do not leave your things on my desk. It's not some kind of personal pen receptacle for you. I don't care how high they promote you, which brings me to item number two... I never formally congratulated you on your promotion, so I'd just like to say...  con-quack-ulations!
...the blood is gushing down, the blood is gushing down... You know, I really would have appreciated a heads-up that you were into dating mothers. I would have introduced you to mine.
There's a knife in your back and the blood is gushing down... M
There's an egg on your head and the yolk is running down, the yolk is running down... M
You seem tense. Hey, you want me to give you the chills?
I don't think there's a whole lot of sleeping going on.  M
I'll give you five bucks for it.
Where did you get that mallard?  K
Punishment fits the crime, I accept.
Mallard.  I put it in your office in order to surveil you.  I was jealous that you got the promotion over me.  J
I'm Jigsaw, idiot.
Michael, can I get you something? A towel? Some cocoa?
Michael, flounder is both a kind of fish and -
A carp is both a fish and a term for complaing. They're mocking you with wordplay.
Hey! It's on the list, everybody.
Just, write it down, please.
It's too small.
I don't want people making fun of my nose.
Michael, please. Stop it now. You're embarrassing yourself.
Play it again.  He purposefully leaned away and let you fall in.
Oh, don't mention it.  You owe me one.  You all owe me one.
No, no, no, no. I got a pumpernickel just for you. A
K. I brought cheese too.  M
Regardless.  That was over two hours ago and it is now a scientific fact that you are hungry.   Bagel?
That's right.  You're a woman and you need to refuse food the first time.  I'll try again.  Please Pam, reconsider and have a bagel.
Let me guess-- you ate the bagel I gave you and loved it.
No, no, no!
Thank you very much for that.
Oh... goodness... thanks.  You know, here's a healthy fitness tip.  If you clench your buttocks together while walking you can really take the pressure off your knees.  A
There is no book.  There's only a survival guide.  A
Oh... no... really? A
What's going on in here?
Don't worry about it.  You can just owe me.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I insist.    A
Alright, move it.
Got it.  Starbucks gift card.  A
Let's get some raw meat on that face.  I got a chicken in the freezer upstairs.
Wait, why are you limping?
You know what you can keep your stupid favor.  It's worthless.  And this is my dinner on your face.  I'm keeping it.  M
Can I have an office?
I'm cashing in the favor.  Fire him.
Good, good.  Keep it on there for another five minutes.  Just let the swelling go down.
The important thing to remember Jim... we always have what is called the element of surprise.
He really is, but not for long.   You let go, you let go.  Oh, you're right, I can't hold on.
Good point.  Second, throat punch, absorb the blow.   Groin punch, hip block, elbow to the gut.  Uh oh, up to the nose.  No, you're not.  Ow!  Oh!
Easy.  Allow me to demonstrate.  I am attacking myself with a throat punch.  Here it comes.  J
That is correct.  Unless there happened to be measles present.
False.  I did choke you with your shoelace.  Now come at me!
No, there is a defense for that.  Let me demonstrate.  Someone attack me.  Kevin, go!
Hello everyone I am sure you have seen the item in the Journal.  I just want to stress that it's all conjecture.  If there's any concrete news you will know ASAP.
This one, from David Wallace to all Dunder Mifflin.
What is the meaning of this email that everyone got?
You know what?  You can all have jobs at Schrute Farms as human scarecrows.  It doesn't pay much and you can't unionize.
I will poison your food.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.  I'm the butler.  You were listening in on that?  You rich people.  You think you can do whatever you want to the servant class!
I know you did it!
You are out of order.
Stop playing games with me, Crawdad.
Hey shut up.  You're dead.
Oh, this could be a juicy one.
OK, I'm ready.
I have crossbows.
OK, everybody just calm down.
Bow down before Recyclops.
Humans are terrible for the environment.
The twirl sucks.
Calves. Calves all the way.
What kind of mileage does this baby get?
Michael Scott you run the most profitable branch of Dunder Mifflin. How do you do it?
I'll ask you a question.
Good luck, Michael.

Dwight Schrute, Scranton branch. I just want to say that I have been standing in this line all day and if this line is any indication of how this company is being run then we are in big trouble.  A take a number option like they have in a deli. What about line varieties? Like an express line for quick comments of ten words or less. They can move much more efficiently. What about ropes along the lines that you can hold on to.
Yeah!  Your idea.
I'm going to run this by Toby and Accounting and have him assemble the data.
In an ideal world, I would have all ten fingers on my left hand, so my right hand could just be a fist for punching.
This encompasses all available data.  Hours, tardiness, unconfirmed sick days, participation.  Everyone has been assigned a random number for total fairness and transparency.  Also, this should be accompanied by a monetary prize.
I didn't mean any of those things I just said.  And you can expect the same from everyone in this office if you don't nip this whole Employee of the Month situation in the bud.  Make it about the work.
That laugh is so infectious.
Cool.  Very cool.  I bet if you tried, you could grow the best beard of anyone in this office.
Hey buddy, so every-
You seem suprised.
He thought you were doing an incredible job last month.
So Jim thought it would be ideal if we all pitched in a 20 for this whole Employee of the Month thing.
Yeah, you said "In an ideal world, there would be a cash prize."  Isn't that what you said?
There must be some reasonable explanation for this.
Excellent idea, Pam.
He knew all along!
Tell him I'm mad at Jim, because he's asking us to give money to Pam.
This is Kevin Malone, is David there?
Oh, you're kidding me!
So what do you want?
What?  Diabolical plan?  I wouldn't even know how to begin a diabol...
Not now, Temp.
Merry Christmas. Good.
But effective, look!  On behalf of Jim and I, Merry Christmas.
This was a successful unveiling! Go back to work! Merry Christmas!

Yes, we are unveiling, an artificial tree, that will never die...
Thirty! Twenty-nine! Twenty-eight!
It is warm feelings.
Not a gun.
Well I don't have all the pieces yet.
What else does it look like?
We don't have a North Pole branch. Idiot.  M
Where? Holiday Inn? I don't ...
What's your pin number?
When? When did he tell you? Today?
You are kidding me!
It's true. We all walk alone.
Michael? Please! Come on!
I have no idea.
Oh, we will. Have a seat.
Dwight? Who is this Dwight? Oh! You mean Dwight Schrute, the company's top salesman and the creator of Computron. I wear many hats but the one I'm currently wearing is that of gracious host.
Ignore him. He's the local lunatic.
He has more character in a single flake of his dandruff then you have in that entire snow bank on your shoulder. Wait, what was the question?
Hope to see you soon.

Just admit you lost track of time.
He's supposed to cut his leg off? Think!
Okay, that's your idea? Exactly like in the movie!? That is the most idiotic thing I have ever heard in my life!
It's kinda smelly, but that might be a plus! And then what?
I have an old barn!
I like where you're going with this. Continue.
Oh, yeah. Great film. Almost as fun as going on a seesaw.
Of course I seesaw. Mose and I seesaw all the time.

Why don't you just let me handle the Tolkien references, okay dumb jock?
I think he is the key. He's very trusting, he's looking for friends, he has been given an awesome amount of power, and does not know how to wield it.
It's not really 1992 anymore.
You know, we really don't announce out loud our sales that much.
No, the cops called us. So I'm gonna need you to give me the password to Jim Halpert's computer.
Listen, I know you have to say that, but we got a little problem here. There is an employee named Jim Halpert, and he is doing some terrible things, okay? He is molesting people via the internet. And we need to stop him.
I imagine one of the best things about being an IT guy is, you get to know everyone's computer passwords.
She sent an email, so.
Michael, it's Phyllis.
Well, well, well. Hm. Boss for, what was it? Oh, four and a half hours? New record. Low. Previous record? Henry Rosston. Boss for nine years, four months. And he only left because he had family matters to attend to and he  what? Michael!
It is not "farm boy swill," I will show you. It is beet Vodka and it is delicious.
Because! Martini bars are pretentious. No thank you.
Oh temp, I like that. I'm going to engrave that into a piece of wood. Care to celebrate with a drink?
Hey there.  Dwight Schrute here.  Listen, uh, would you be interested in restocking on paper? ...  Yeah, I could sure use the money.  My cousin, uh, came down with a case of that nasty new goat fungus.  Oh, it's just horrific.  The  doctor says he'd never seen it beard so quickly.  Okay.
No, no!  You need to come by your sales honorably!
Wait a minute!  You can't do that.  You cannot exploit your baby for sales.
I want to have a child for business reasons and I want you to be the mother.  If you agree, say nothing.  If you disagree, say anything...  Very well.  Let's meet at 4:00 PM at our old meeting spot and bang it out.

Nothing left to do except dot the I's, the J's, and the umlauts.  Why don't you meet me here at exactly mid-late afternoon?
Alright.  I'll call you, kid.
Are they now?  Ha ha, how some people spend their money, right?  Ha ha.
Hey, listen.  I know that I'm an adult, but maybe I could come by sometime for a teeth cleaning.  You know, just for fun.

Turned out fine for me. But Mose? Oh. Same story, different ending.
I'll tell you what happened to me. I didn't see my father for the first two years of my life. I thought my mother was my father, and my wet-nurse was my mother.
I mean, you're here at work, and the baby thinks that the refrigerator is its father.
Must be amazing being a father right, a miracle of life?

Okay?  "The cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon, little boy blue-"

Well, you see, I actually do have a meeting. With a client. I'm just gonna reschedule for next week. J
Hello, Dwight Schrute?
This is not Mega-Desk.
What the hell is this?
You couldn't handle my undivided attention.
Sorry, Michael, I got calls to make.
Yeah, what about those leads? Did you hear anything from corporate?
Yeah. You got any news on the leads? ... Okay, I'll tell you what. I'm going out on a very important sales call. You get any news about the leads, you try me. All of my numbers. All six of my numbers, okay? Including the car phone!  Alright, Dwight out!
... is there any news on the leads?
When I was asking about the leads.

Any brothers or sisters?

No, no, no, no. I want a big family. Tall. Thick. A big, physically big family. Listen, you go have fun. You're off the hook.
Look, I've been thinking. We had a good run. We really did. But you don't need to worry about this whole contract thing anymore.

And this was after I have no other recourse but to tell her and gym security that you had me sent there to see if she was cheating. Also, I joined the gym. You'll be billed monthly. [lays down gym membership receipt on a chair in Michael's office. M
People who don't trust egg whites. M
I'm positive. Yeah, oh, and here's your expense receipts right there. M
Put your fingers here.  M
Yeah, no. She's not cheating. Oh, man! Will you help me work out this knot? Right here.
Oh, I pulled muscles in both my thighs. Thanks for asking.
No! The hill's a trap. Let's take the dirt road off to the side. Gym i
Ready, one bullet. And boom!
Toby, come on.
Come on, the whole two bullet thing is a red herring. Here's how you do i
No, hmmm... that's still...
You were being really funny, and then you went too far.
Michael, nice tie or something.
Just try. I will do legal jujitsu on you. Gyah!  See, don't even need to make contact. The law will do it.
How do we know this? I'd like to see a stool sample.
And wake up in the future.
Unless we're unplugged.
Which we can't know.
Same page. Just keep moving.
"Intercourse to completion. Five individual times rendered at my discretion?"
Look, I will not pay.
Fine. Five times.
I could have stopped him.
Oh, it'll work.  Mm. Stop kissing me. It's not in the contract.
Never mind. Just never mind. A
God, Angela, why is that always my responsibility?
You're with Big Brother? Okay, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Apache persuasion hold, that's the hell! What are you doing to my computer?
Oh, sure thing, go ahead. N
Hey, IT guy.
I'm not dumb. I'm smart.
Are you referring to alchemy? J
Why would I disparage a company that has made me rich beyond my wildest dreams? J
Hold that thought. I don't want to waste your time, and I wouldn't dare waste mine. I didn't do it. Now, I don't know exactly who did it, but I have a list right here...  You should fire the following people.
Basement office? You mean like a lair?
Ready?  Dwight Schrute.
Cancel it. I want you to make an offer at seventeen twenty-five Slough Avenue. Make 'em an offer they can't refuse. No, on second thought, low ball them. Don't call me 'til you have it. R
All right. Sounds good.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey IT guy. Here's the story, champ. None of us have spent a lot of time getting to know you, okay? We liked the last guy, Siddiq, because he kept to himself, and we also thought he might have been a terrorist. You know what, I'm going to leave you with one other thought. Inner city kids use computers for two things, games and porn. So good luck wasting your life, lurch. N
Well, I'm one-eighths proud of you... enjoy that chair for now... 'cause pretty soon, you will be on your feet, at Buckingham Palace.
Jim, you have one job to do. And you do it forgettably.  Those of us who are busy require hands-free hydration.
Like you'd ever be cold, Kevin. Stop asking me hypothetical questions, OK? I'm too busy.
From now on, if you're hot, sit on an ice pack.
Give me that.
The bigger the key chain, the more powerful the man.
Yes. Of course.
I've got 56 ounces of fluid in my bladder! And we have to establish a pee corner! P
Well, don't look, freak!
Use your talons! Pry 'em open!
Pam, try and pry open those front doors, immediately. P
Okay, that's weird. Just hitting "door closed." What?
How ya doin'?
No one. The door locks from the outside. Escape is impossible. J
Jim! To you and me, maybe, but, come on! To a child's imagination that's Mr. Fork and Lieutenant Knife and... Ms. Fork. P
Come on. Here is the language skills and cognitive development area. These are English... uh... letters.  I see you found out magical toy box Jim. J
Oh no. I like to think of it as a kids place. Would you like a tour?
You remember my cousin Mose.
I went to the store and I pressed the buzzer, and they looked right at me, and then they looked away. And then I pressed the buzzer again, and they started taking pictures of me on their mobile phones. I guess I'm not the kind of guy that's good enough for precious heirlooms.
You guys know me. You know that I'm not one for fancy things, but there was this one thing. It was in a fancy store. And it caught the corner of my eye when I took Mose down to the Mall to get his blood pressure at the Rite-Aid. And I thought, you know, maybe I deserve this. You know, I had a great crop yield this fall...
Yes I did. And I'm going to do the same with all of your clients. S
Apparently, it's one of the best revenge stories of all times, in which this sex worker, who is the antagonist... That can't be right. Andy? How does it...?
Copy. Thank you.
Do you have your card? A
I'll take the wizard!
You made a big mistake. Huge!
Good sir. I happen to have been working a very long day. When I came to you fine establishment. You are such a... I'm gonna... Ok. Listen. You can't treat... Thank you! Good morning sir!
It was beet juice! I am a beet farmer idi...
I was here yesterday, and you refused to wait on me.
It is a pewter wizard holding a crystal. J
Uh, no, thank you. Last time I went to the theater, a man dressed as a cat sat on my lap.
Alright, fine. I'll go to your little show, but I'm not wearing a cape.
His name's Andy. He's a terrible salesman.
Too bad I'm not gonna explain anything that you miss. A
I will tell. I will tell the mediator. What-what are you...
No, no, no. Contractually we're obligated to have sex.
It's okay, I smell. A
Ok, good. Me too, get in the car.
You speak English?
Y el accento, donde are you from?
Hola, tu es une buena worker?
A bat! Impressive...
When did the phrase do or die become so corrupted?
I left him all the tools he needs. This is do or die. If he chooses correctly he'll conquer the hornets...
That is my new maintenance worker, Nate. And you'll be happy to know that he's taking care of that hornet's nest that you've been griping about.
Then I will.
You need to contact every woman you've been with, and notify them of your herpes infestation. It's the right thing to do.
You need to contact Holly! You need to notify her, that she is crawling with herpes.
You may have...
What port? The Jan port. The Holly Por...
Some eggs can rely dormant in a woman for years, they may not even know they have it.
So long Donna!
He forgot to mention the herpes.
Ok I'm gonna head outta here, I know you have a lot to talk about. Ok, is there a, an operating theater that's open to visitors? Never mind I'll find it.
We had to come over right away, it's urgent. Michael has something to tell you.
I don't understand the reference.
TO answer your question about Jan, no. Jan is insane. Why do you think I got- LEFT, WILLOW NOW!
Who gave it to you, who has it, and who is going to pay.
Forget it Michael! Today is about herpes.
Wait, what Holly said?
Jan knows paper.
Come on old lady. Let's go.Old W
Excuse me, someone died in the upstairs bathroom didn't they?
The democratic primaries,
The woods behind the liquor store, the swamp behind the old folk's home.
Fence with a hole in it..
I'm gonna need a list of every man you've ever had sex with. I'm talking train stations, men's rooms...
It was probably just an ingrown mustache hair but we have to be exhaustive.
Can't beat a horse. A horse is a bike that peddles itself.
Alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait for me! It's weird if I come in slightly after.
No, Mr. Jock Hipster.
And who is this "the" Steve Nash?
Will you stop trying to put it in terms you think they'll understand? It's condescending.
Also, he slept with Pam.
The best salesman ever. He works for Osprey Paper over in Throop, steals more clients from Dunder-Mifflin than anyone.
He's not just here for the coffee, Jim. Wake up!
Like hell you are.
What are you doing?
So anyway, she says, "that is the biggest penis I have ever seen." And I said, "I know. That's why I brought you to the Penis Museum, where tickets are a thousand dollars." Well, hello Danny!
What'd he say? What did he say?
I've been in showtime mode since breakfast.
He's not kidding.
Yes, you did.
I know how we can learn his tricks.
The Sting. The Sting.
Yes, Jim. And with a little tweaking, it becomes a different office. We lure Danny to it and watch him sell.
Van Helsing was a respected professor before he was a vampire killer.
He's very, very handsome.
People can't keep their true natures hidden for long, and this guy is smoldering like a tire fire.
Okay, and remember-you're not gay.
We gotta see what he's got.
Then make him pitch to you.
I told you! You're an exec at Stark Industries, a corporation you inherited from your father-
Michael! No, Michael, stop it! No!
Where's he gonna park? There's no more reserved parking spots.
Where's he gonna sit? There's no more seats.
It's about this very announcement you just made.
Can I talk to you about something?
It's after 5:00, Jim. I'm not gonna take this home.
Oh, that's different, is it? Okay...thief. You better check your things, people. In fact, where are my keys? Oh, there in my pocket. False alarm. Okay.  So...you're gonna be workin' here?
Let me handle this, Jim. Drop the act, Cordray, okay? We all know that you probably thought that Pam was too "meh" or thin without being toned. But I wanna tell you something-she is one of the plain hearty women of Scranton that make this city great. And so what if she doesn't wear makeup?  We like her better that way! And you steal clients, don't you? Don't you!
You snubbed her.
So long, Stanley!
You're only one third as beautiful and only half her height.
To my chickens I'm the Scranton Strangler.   Oh-ho! That's very funny. Looks like someone decided to dress up as old Dwight Schrute's mom.
Pam is gonna choose whoever has a scent most like that of her father. Does anyone remember what her dad smelled like?
Yeah. Here's another good idea. Corporate chain of command. We need to strangle Darryl's idea.
No. Shh. Michael, listen. This cannot stand. We can't have workers going straight to corporate. Makes your job superfluous. M
He went over your head to go behind your back. M
He went to Gabe behind your back.
Hmm, Kevin and Gabe. Probably about the extremes of the human physique.
Let's just say I saw exactly what the two of you wanted me to see.
Yes. I would welcome it.
Exposing yourself to germs is the best way to make yourself stronger.
The worst thing you can do for your immune system is to coddle it. They need to fight their own battles. If Sabre really cared about our well-being, they would set up hand de-sanitizing stations. A simple bowl at every juncture filled with dirt, vomit, fecal matter... P
NO, no, no. They will cost you your life.
Uh-huh. Right. And ruin their cloaks? Do you have any idea how expensive wool is in Transylvania?  'Cause of the euro.
Good morning. Dwight Schrute. Thank you all for your prayers and your remembrances. Like Justin and his disfigurement, I too have had a horrible year. They say that the middle class is disappearing, and with it, the soul of America. So, as a gift to this beautiful congregation, I would like to offer a 4% discount on all Dunder Mifflin Sabre products if you buy a printer at full price.
Shh, shh, shh.
Opus dei.Male church m
I'll call you back.
I am ready to love thy neighbor with these kind of discounts.
Michael, I'm just about to close a sale. Can I authorize a 15% discount?
They shouldn't televise any of this, it just encourages copy-cats.
Tonight might be a convenient night for us to have some intercourse.
Not because I want to. With all the feeling to base a show around. Glee? Thirst. Now that's a show I'd watch.
In the Schrute family, the youngest child always raises the others. I've been raising children since I was a baby.
Michael, I find it absolutely disgraceful that no one followed you in here for your walk-out. I took the liberty of making a list of everyone who didn't follow you in here. Jim. Oscar. Creed. Me, at first.
Really? Oh... Then here we are.
You know it's not really necessary for me to sit here holding her all night. Just go into Gabe's refrigerator, get a lump of suit, or any kind of congealed animal fat will do rally, tie a piece of string to it and the other end to her toe, put the suit in her mouth, she'll be happy for hours.
That would be nice wouldn't it?
Surprise me. No! Pepperoni.
Enough. I will require beer and pizza to think this over.
I do. But you married my worst enemy.
I have something to do.
Well something's come up, I have to go.
She loves me.
What are you doing?
A single piece of pepperoni please.
She's in heat. She will eat your face off!
You ever been with the blondes before? It's the big leagues.
Yeah sure, Jim could go see her.
Oh come on, stop the fake prissy act. We're in the real world. Sex contracts exist!
I have a legal obligation to Angela. Okay, she needs to be serviced.
No. Crust first.  Now I've gotta go meet Angela.
I'd prefer for him to think of it as degrading.
No, try me.
Try "Big Boobs" with a "Z".
Okay, now try Zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, one.
Try zero, Zero, Zero, Zero, zero, zero.
Every fall, my Uncle Eldred used to build us a maze out of hay bales for us kids to play in. We called it "Hay Place". Eldred Called it "Hay World". Eventually lawyers were brought in. But that's all behind us. Hay Place lives on!  Watch it, watch it.
So, uh...  Excuse me, get off of there! Those are show bales, not play bales.
Yes, why don't we meet at the usual spot.  Uh... I've got a half an hour during lunch in-between the historical reenactment of the dunmore farm slaughters and the onion boil. A
Oh, our contract.
Roll in the hay, five dollars. A
Oh, and the Petting Zoo closes at 2:00, and the Goat Roast is at 3:00. Come on in, enjoy!
Oh, I bet you do. You know what? When I was a little kid, they couldn't get me off the hayride! But it's gonna cost you three more bucks.
Nothing. Life Lesson? Some tasks are not worth doing.
D-E-A. Oop, backspace. A. Dear.
I'm sorry Pam, allow me to write you an apology letter.
Twenty minutes a day Jim, that's all it takes. Twenty minutes a day, all feet, no hands and I'll have the pedi-dexterity of a chimp, and you'll be sitting there like an idiot.
China is on the move?
You know what Pam? You're right. This isn't just a business. This is a home, and I would much rather see a smile from Kevin than save hundreds on plumbing and electricity.
Dwight Schrute. Mhm. Tell her I'm busy. I don't know, make something up.
Well then you're not going to talk to the new building owner. Which is a shame, because I hear he's a very reasonable guy.
Pam, when I'm sitting at this desk, I'm a salesman. If you wanna talk to the new building owner, you should call Nate and schedule and appointment.
"Which is you" is not a sentence.
Stanley, as a fellow Dunder Mifflin employee I feel for you. But, like you, I am completely powerless to the whims of the new building owner.
I'm sorry, isn't that good enough for your anus? Don't get me started on how coddled the modern anus is.
I say we bomb 'em. By 2020, they're gonna be the world's largest economy and they're getting a taste for protein. We'll all starve.
Or else? Or else what? There's nothing you can do.
You can't just move out.
Let me see.
Waste of time.
You can't possibly be serious.
Yeah, no. I'm not a genie. I'm just talking about a...
You don't wanna move. Moving is one of the most stressful things you can do in life. You'll probably just take it out on your kid. Jim will turn to the drink. The family will fall apart, and twenty five years from now, Cece will become world famous...  for stripping.
Why do you even need soap? Are you that bad at going to the bathroom?
I can't wait to do to Pam, what I just did... to Pam.
Damn it, Pam. Get out. Right now. Leave it, I mean it. Get the hell out of here. Go.Passer-
So, okay. You're not a liar too are you?Passer-
I'm sorry. We have a colleague with the same name.Passer-
She was lying. Oh, Pam, Pam...Dwight & N
There's no building. This could only mean one thing.
Here it is, right here, pull over. Oh my God. No way. Man, look at that.
You're a funny guy Pam. What's the first thing you guys are gonna do when you move in to the new office? I'm going to walk down the hall and say "Wow, I can't believe this is real, but it is." I can't wait.
How many offices are there? Oh I'll just look at the one sheet myself.
What's the exact square footage.
Yeah, but I'm still an employee here, and that part of me is really excited about the change of scenery. What's the square footage in the new place?
Y'know what, I'm the only one here who you haven't asked about the new office.
Impossible, I love the law.
Let me see you jump.  Oh, my God. This is a store bought-camera. This isn't one of those special military-grade cameras that would be able to capture that.
You are? P
I'll tell you who. Darryl, Phyllis, Stanley, Angela, and Oscar.
Oh come on.
No, Andy, it's a snowball fight. It's not fun. Go get your own thing. Beat it.  Jim, let go. Let go.
Very well, then I challenge you to a snowball fight on the first real snow of winter.
You apologize right now.
You apologize to me right now.
Look at that. There's a pebble in there. You coulda killed me.
Damn it, Jim, you cannot throw snowballs in here!
Oh, my God! It's the first snowfall of Christmas. Is that just so magical for you, little girl? Can you not wait to have a hot chocolate, and cuddle up with Papa and tell him about all your Christmas dreams, hmm? It's not even a real snow. Look, it's a dusting. Pitiful.
Is it the middle school teacher who tried to turn her foreign exchange student into a sex slave?
Death to Toby!
Ahhhhhhh!!!! Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!
Huh? You like that?
Oh, no. Yes, taste my wrath!
Oh, no. Oh, no!
I find that unlikely. You email me when you get a new zit.
Wait, what girlfriend?
With snowballs, Jim? With fluffy little snowballs? No. I thought we were just playing.
I could not agree more. And just want to state for the record that I am intending to sue Jim for acute psychological distress.
Okay, hey, hey, hey...
Dear God in heaven.
Didn't think your affectionate nicknames would be your undoing, did you, Jim? Let that be a lesson to you all.
I'll take that as a no.
You hit Pam in the face with a snowball while I watch.
I do not accept your surrender. There's only one way that I would ever relent.
This meeting is for Knights of the Night only.
Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. No, Jim, hey!
Okay. Knights stayed outside to play flashlight tag.
And the rest was just stuff.
Reflective strips were glued to patrol jackets. Knights went outside with flashlights to test them. J
Fine. Minutes from previous meeting of Knights of the Night. That's our official name, Jim.
What are you going to do now? Are you going to make fun of our leader's weird voice? Huh? . Over the line, Jim.
No, no, no, no, no. I see how this movie ends. You make fun of me, everyone laughs, ha, ha, ha... screw you!
Wow. Did your baby draw that? A
Hey, hey, hey. Want me to crank the thermostat up to 90, smoke her out? She can't keep those mittens on forever.
Okay, I'll drive.
Wait, it's that easy? That's not a resolution, that's just... something I want to do. Okay, fine. I can do that...  My resolution is... meet a loose woman.
I've achieved plenty and there's no better than the best.
Not doing that.
I'll take the entirety of the second floor.  D
Oh, really? What else? Let me see.
Okay. What'd you get?
Yeah, pretty much. But, you know, this place is kinda tapped out, so. Let's roll.
Yeah, yeah! A
Good. Real good.
Is that what we were doing? D
Well, we can't just go back, I mean, we came out to meet women.
I am not going back until I fulfill my resolution.
Strip club. I was looking at the strippers at the strip club.
Wow! Younger G
That's great. There's a big, big future in that. P
Some of these people are for real.
Hey hey hey. Let me answer this. Stupid question. He went back to the office, obviously, which is that way. H
No word from Michael. H
This is a man-hunt slash rescue mission.
Uncanny. Put a pin in that.  This way, this way, this way? I don't know. Do you know?
Not you, Erin. H
Okay, my name is j...j...j...j...j...j...j...j Jim Halpert and I will fax it in to you... under you. I'll fax it under you. Oh, excuse me. I just p...p...p...p pissed my pants. Not really. I didn't really.  J
And what is the hook-up zone policy on masturbation? M
Michael, that's absurd. What if two couples want to go at the same time? M
Movie idea? M
I can see that happening.
I can see that as a very real possibility.
That's a realistic time line.
I can see that happening, yes.
No. Because you laughed at me. Kevin will be eaten! Pam will be taken slave! Jim will be made a warlord's gesture. Meredith will do ok. Be assured this day will come. It's just a matter of time. Could be one month, could be two months.
Hardy har har. Okay picture t
They're still good for another week.
Holly, you approved this?
Why's he talking to Holly?
No it is not.
I have been sitting here for ten years, Michael.
Well there's a lot of seats in the annex.
I didn't order anything.
What do you grow in here, bullcrap?
Kevin, in sumo culture, you'd be considered a promising up and comer.
'Cause I wanna let bygones be bygones. Show you I'm cool. You're the new guy. It's cold out. I made too much. I got this awesome hot chocolate recipe from my wife.
Hey Packer, I made you some hot chocolate.
Yeah, write up your list of one hundred, edit it down to your top forty, then e-mail it to me, and I'll read it over.
Why don't you write up your best forty ideas and e-mail them to me. Can you do that?
Who is Justice Beaver?
Ooh does Edgar Allan Poe know about that one? So sinister! That wouldn't annoy a person at all! Where do you come up with this stuff?
Pepto-Bismol, in his hot chocolate.
None of your business.
Eat a brog. Maybe it's because I didn't understand it. I just had a couple of notes, let me grab a pen.  Damn it. Gah! Just when we were getting going.
They're all good. So good! Number t
Harry Potter World is supposed to be faaantastic!
And you make sure to get down there and check out that Harry Potter World.
No, no, no. That is not part of the plan. That is actually anti-what we're doing.
It wasn't my first choice, Jim had so many better ideas.
He took my desk.
I'm not closing the door.
This is how business...
The warmth will lure people inside.
It's good that its cold it will drive business inside.
Not so fast.
That's how it's done.
Come on, its trash, like your sign, unless you have this.
And the Jennifer Weiner collection.
People like Ryan? Let me tell you about men like him. He comes over and you're like 'Hey baby let me light a candle' then you pull out this one half used and he's like 'Uh! Who else is she seeing? I better lock her down fast.'
Oh, cause there's a huge line of people waiting in line who want your spinster chotskies.
Nice try. No. Correction. Terrible try.
So you wanna sell me magic beans.
That's a common swindlers trick.
Professor Copperfield's Miracle Legumes?
Oh, its just Stanley's old photo album. I'm thinking about throwing it in the garbage. I mean, why would I want some random black mans old photo album on my bookshelf. I'm not James Franco.
Ryan, you have such an interesting mind. So creative. All these new business ideas and artistic projects.
just out of curiosity, what were the claims for those beans?
All right, I'll take them.
That... that's impossible.
I know right... what the?
I want to be manager. I just don't understand why I wasn't even interviewed for the job. What's wrong? I was totally qualified, you were pushing for me.
That's because I'm your right-hand man, Michael, but I can't do it again. I can't do it again for a whole new guy. M
There's no turtle, Michael. I just wanted to get you here.
From when he recommended me to replace him.
Can't you just use the recommendation you already have on file?
I left a message at corporate.
Correction. Just you. Alright, meeting. Multi-function room. D
Every day is black tie optional!
Just a little announcement folks, remember, the Dundies is a black tie affair.
Appalling.  Surprisingly adequate! Okay everyone! The activities commence in four seconds!
Big smiles folks! There they are. M
Excuse me, can I get a photo of the Best Mom and the Best Dad please?
And next time, why don't you pick a co-host, that doesn't have microphone-a-phobia!
I just don't see a point in the Dundies! Okay? The jokes are terrible, the venue is bad, the fashion is boring.
Gladly! I'd accept that award, because a bitch, is a female dog!
We should just wait here and not get good seats in the conference room?
Any kind of meat that you can possibly name!
Black Bears can smell a salami at five miles Michael, what are you thinking?! And they run faster than a horse, so if you were thinking about outrunning one on a horse I would try a cheetah. You, in tight pants, Michael, are a salami to a Black Bear. Do you understand?  You're like a giant walking salami!
Especially if you think that life would be better without Legs!
Where did you hear that? Obvious XM Radio?
What is wrong with you? I'm the sick freak? After what you did? You expect to be buttled? You didn't recommend me?!
Colorado specialty, Rocky Mountain Oysters.
I've got a treat for you!
I think you'll find what you're looking for  over there.
It's just that I own the coffee shop.  So, once you've seen sausage being made, all you want to do is make sausage, because it's so much fun.
Oh, wow, thank you.  That was so kind of you.
No you're not.
I'm just not a suck-up like everyone else around here.  Okay?  I do my job well, so why don't you just leave me alone and let me do it.  Okay?
Congratulations on your one cousin.  I have seventy.  Each one better than the last.
What's the argument here?  NBA, WNBA.  One is a sport, one is a joke.  I love sports, I love jokes.  Room for all.
Deangelo, tell your whore to leave me alone.
Pass.  If I wanted to see a pissing contest, I'd lock Mose in the chicken coop.
Wait, wait. All in favor of the knapsack filled with canned goods, chainsaw, gasoline, and emergency radio in case he wakes up post-apocalypse?
No, you can't get flowers for someone who's in a coma. They'll wilt before he wakes up.
Please take note of the new color-coding system.
General meet-and-greet. So I expect you to be on your best behavior, which means none of you will be insubordinate, nor will you foment insurrection.
That's on a need-to-know basis.
Excellent. Morning announcements! There's been a problem with some people sharing copier codes. Your copier code is a distinct 21-digit number that is unique to you, and you only, okay? Don't share it.  Jo Bennett, our CEO, will be here today for a high-level meeting involving Gabe and myself. E
All right. You stop me when I reach the diseased area.
Gotcha! Why are you late?
Okay, you know what? I would love to join The Fist. J
Don't make me fire you.
The desk is a replica of Uday Hussein's desk. I saw a picture in Newsweek. Listen, I'm a very busy man. Let's get right down to business. J
Now I want you to find out what people are saying about me, things they don't want me to know abou- Ohh... it's a holster.
Everyone here thinks that you're a joke. They think that you were hired because of your good looks, which won't last long anyway. As your pale skin and severe bone structure imply, you'll age swiftly and poorly. J
Why would I put a banana in my holster? K
Why do you need to keep wearing those booby shirts all the time?
The holster was a gift from my great-uncle Honk. Um, I don't know. I guess he's saying that he's proud of me. A
Okay, everyone! Conference room, right now!
Okay, why are you calling Jo?
No, no, no. All we know is that a gun fired. That's all we know! No. That's not true. Actually, we heard a loud noise. Later, a hole was seen. No one saw the bullet leave the gun. A
Because you guys are my best friends, and I mean that. Managing you for this last week has been the greatest honor of my life. And if you ruin this, I will burn this office to the ground. And I mean that figuratively. Not literally. Because you guys are so... so important... to me. I love you guys. But don't cross me. But you're the best.
I just really, really think we should handle this internally. R
Really? You did? What hand was I holding the gun in? What did Andy's tie look like?
Did they say what caused it? Because I know you like putting Q-tips deep into your ear canal. A
What's jazz hands?
I put everything back in the vending machine. K
Okay, fine. You can go on your singing audition. P
Well, what can you do? Life.
Okay. Did I make a mistake? Yes. Do I regret the decision that I made? Yes. J
Pam made me put a banana in my holster.
I am telling you this because I care too much about this job to be blackmailed into doing it poorly. All I've ever wanted was to be manager here. And if you feel that you cannot promote me over this one accident, I understand. But if you think that extortion is worse -
I'm kneading it!
Okay, how's that? K
I can't. I can't push harder!
Okay, okay. Shh!
Bread is the paper of the food industry. You write your sandwich on it.
They won't make me manager, and I won't settle for anything less. I've gone about as far as I can here. That's obvious. Time to take my talents elsewhere.
Stop trying to figure me out.  Do you even know anything about paper? How it's made?
No, it's not.
I want an interview.
Let me get that for you.
Fine. I'll do it without you, but you'll regret this.
Erin will eat garbage for your entertainment.
I'm going to make you an offer. Okay? You even do so little as grant me an interview, I will guarantee you your dream work life. Okay? You roll in at 10 a.m. to your own private reserved parking spot, pick up your daily free coffee from Dwight's Caffeine Corner, unlimited sex breaks for you and Pam...
Okay, I know why you're saying that, Jim, I really do, but think of it this way. The hand that reaches from the grave to grip your throat  is the strong hand you want on the wheel.
Great! Oh, that's great... We never were very good at small talk, were we, Jim?
Peepa, how is she?
What's your daughter's name again? Peepee?
Good. They good?
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ohh, I enjoy laughing at my mistakes, because I've learned so much from them. I'd like to be interviewed for the position.
Jo, may I speak to you for a second?
I would have dressed this way every day, legally changed my name, learned French sign language, shown up, and been the best damn branch manager you'd ever seen!
Uhh. Wait. Wait! No. Stop! Stop. Jo...  It's me. I'm Dwight.
Assistant Regional Manager.
Assistant Regional Manager.
Assistant Regional Manager.
What will be your first priority? I will have seven first priorities. Safety, profits, fostering a community of self-reliance and entrepreneurship, listening, respect for human life, bolstering our public image, and...  I am going to institute a strict no-firearms policy for this office that extends to myself as well. Wow. All of my concerns are disappearing.
Okay! If you're not going to interview me, then I'll do it.
I demand more questions!
You have to interview me...
What a surprise! Minorities sticking together.
Well, it's not entirely up to you, is it? Seems to me like someone's getting a little power-mad.
We're gonna miss you, Gabe.
No, I insist.
Say no more.
Okay, which side of the list am I on?
 2, 3!
Phyllis! Phyllis! You okay? You okay?
It cant be nothing.
Shhh, Pam. Cmon, dont be such a right-sider.
Thats great. Lets do this guys.
No, its not. Heres how we find out. Lets line up and compare the lines, see if we learn anything. Okay, left-siders over here. Right-siders, line up over here. Face each other. Match it by height and relative weight. Lets just size each other up here and left side of the list ATTACK!
Ha ha, I knew it! Ha ha! Yes! Woo!
Oh, we did. It was the best time. And you know what? Now its over. Back to work everyone. You too Andy.
Jim, shut the door. This is just gross.
God. How do whalers do it?
Then expect to be shocked. Jim, you owe me $14.75. Oscar, $14.75. Darryl....
Oh, tips are expected?
I insist. It is gonna be our treat, please?
You know what? Let us treat you. What do you say? It has been such a pleasure.
OK, lets look at some ties.
Is this really the best use of our collective time?
Youre really going to want the booster.
Oh no no no.  Without the battery pack and optional memory booster, its barely three pounds. R
So, you can tell your c
We could talk about how fast children grow up, and before you know it theyre out of the house.
You wanted the job, the job is yours.  Just do the job!  And Ill do mine.. walnuts?
I dont know, what do you mean?
Oh, it is. And beets are not immune.  We made some inroads in salads, but heirloom tomatoes are pushing back.
Good. Really really good.
Is this about the profits? Because if it is I just dont see the point. Its so Wall Street.
Let me guess, somebody needs a brownie?  Lick the spoon?
Yeah, that'll work.
Nein. Sits.  Goot.
Whoa, Oscar! What are you- What? No, hey!
There you go! Here doggy! He's not even trying. Come here doggy, come on.
OK, you know what? I'm gonna give him something to drink. Come here, doggy.  Come on.
I know what you'd do with all that money.  Hey Pam, let's buy expensive bathrobes and hug.
Hey...OK no. No. That. You are so not...oh god.  False. Andy, I will volunteer.
Negative! Three hundred boxes for me, zero for you chumps. Deal with it!
Kevin! Doesn't apply.
Like baboons or elephants.
No, no. Very smart. Uh, theirs is more of a physical intelligence.
Well, they whipped people which was helpful. But you're right. We should be able to find a more efficient way of moving boxes than Madge or Heday.
Hey, idiot. What did Erin want again?
Yep. He'll be fine.
And it's clear we're not going to carry them.
It's not the greatest one either...
Get the thing, go! Lube it up, Kevin! Start mopping.Dwight, Erin, Jim & K
It's uh, it's in beta testing.
OK. You know what? It's been a real busy day, what do you say we put all this away.
I don't know.
OK, I can see why you're angry, you're coming into this cold. But believe me a lot of thought went into this.
Uh, it's not totally empty.
Right. Now do you wanna wear a trash bag, er...
I wouldn't be asking you lightly, now would I?
So if I was to ask you to sacrifice your body and lay down on a greasy corner and act as a human bumper shield-
I know. Kevin, we've been friends for a long time, right?
Yeah, why is it so far away Jim?
What's going on?
It's simpler this way.
And please refer to the map, stay off of the web. Thank you.
There's so much more to it than that.
They don't warn you when the cameras are driving by.
MR. AND MRS. WALTER AND ELLEN BERNARD!
It'll all be goat.
I can get you exotic meats  hippo steaks, giraffe burgers...
Oh really? Well, we have a number of birthday packages. The Pewter Package has the least amount of goats, not no goats, it's still 10-12 goats, depending on the availability of the goats. Now the Goat Package obviously has the most goats. What were you thinking? R
That's a stupid question, obviously mISTER JAMES HALPERT!
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
Stop forgetting things.
MR. JAMES HALPERT!
When all this is over, I'd like to actually go to one of Trickington's parties, they sound like a blast.
Has no one here heard of Kerrigan, from Starcraft? Queen of blades? It's all Toby's fault.
Ryan, will you please tell her who I am?
It's called a costume.
Yeah, but no nipples.
Kerrigan is ruler of the Zerg swarm!
Damnit. I AM Kerrigan from Starcraft! I've been censored.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman, leave me alone, ghoul.
Yeah, perfectly mediocre.
Open up a newspaper.  Oh look a hurricanes coming.  I suppose youre going to tell me the scariest animal is a shark?
Thats really rude.  I dont tell you hurricanes suck even though its true.
Its a root you idiot.
Yeah Im serious.
Got 'em. Go!
The city of Atlanta.
Uh, I know what it is. Ok? I have like a thousand people over every week to watch it. Ok? We all kinda hate it though.
I'm a Jamaican zombie woman. Leave me alone, ghoul.
WhaYes. Your attention. Uh because No that is all.
Sorry, go ahead.
I will do my voodoo.
Well, I can make this work. I'll set it up right now. Just need your go ahead.
Have I not been worthy of your trust? Have I not been a reliable number two?
Ughshould've used a shorter string. Never mind, I know it by heart. It is a system that holds people accountable for everyone else's work.
Smilenod. Smile and nod.
Jim, you're trying to make me sound like some kind of evil maniac. Now the point is that we are now working in an environment where we have accountability to each other. I am confident that you guys are equal to the task.
No, it's an accountability booster.
P.S. We should should kill him.
Robert's favorite s
Or in this case an email gets sent to Robert California containing the consultants report from last year. Remember the one that recommended the branch be shutdown? And as a fail-safe also every negative email you've ever written about him to the group will also be forwarded to him.
The accountability booster. It registers every time a mistake has been made in the office. From a late delivery to an accounting error. Five strikes in a day equals a home run. One home run and you're out.
But the device will change that. Without a safety net, people will improve.
It's not a doomsday device, gosh.  We can do this you guys.
Oh, there's one mistake.
I haven't even considered it. That's how sure I am that this accountability booster is going to work.
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three mistakes already is pretty terrible, but I do see improvement. Meredith kept someone on hold for thirty minutes and now look she's hard at work.
No. Oh shoot. Ha ha haYou guys are never gonna shut down the machine, ok? But I appreciate your energy and your team work. If you applied this to your regular work, You won't even notice that the device is there, watching you ready to strike.
How about Scrantonstrangler666.
Good luck finding a new job idiots. I'll make sure to write you a glowing reference. Glowingly negative.
Ha. Ok, alright. Andy back me up here, please.
Hey, you can't just change the rules because you don't like the outcome. What about you, Kevin? What about you and your fake task? Can you tell me now where paper comes from?
No you didn't, Phyllis. You complained the whole time. You yelled at me. You tried to break into the machine.  What?!
You don't deserve to have this branch. Five mistakes in less than a day.
Well, I would have to enter my password in order to cancel it.
It goes out automatically at five P.M.
If you hit another horse, you've dug to far.
What does it look like I'm doing? Digging a grave for a horse.
This is the new addition, built my Erasmus Schrute in 1808. It doubled as a tuberculosis recovery room until 2009.
Okay. Take off your shoes. Except you Kevin, they stay on.
In. I'm hungry.
Don't say cow- Ugh.
Any specific animal?
I hadn't heard that before, that's, that's funny.
Did you just have a stroke, Pam? It's "Nobody's perfect." Nice stroke, Pam.
Well I just thought with my new increased responsibilities and all...
Maybe I could sit in on this one with you? You know, that way I can cover you in case you need to urinate or you just want another opinion, or defecate...
Andy Im really sorry about your mother. My deepest condolences.
Oh we know.
Yes you are. And another thing. Helen Mirren was born Helen Mironov. Thats right. Youre fake salivating over a Soviet era Russian.
No! There are universal biological standards of beauty and attraction. And you are purposefully celebrating the opposite of them to mollycoddle a pregnant woman.
Ok ok ok no no no. This is disgusting. You realize what youre saying? The hottest thing ever would be a 66 year old pregnant woman.
Her breasts are large, her waist is small, her reproductive health in ample evidence. And facial symmetry- come on.
That's just absurd.
If we're going to work together, we need some ground rules.
Done.  I never touch a pregnant woman.
You think Jims lying?  That's so cute. I know he's lying.
Meh... you were at your most attractive when you were 24 with a slight, gradual decline and a steep drop-off when you got pregnant for the first time. Gradual recovery and, uh, well now, obviously, you're at an all-time low.
Why would I or anyone else think that you're hot right now? I can't impregnate you, and that's the driving force between male-female attraction.
So important. And then we will destroy the man himself.
None taken. What do you got?
Just ugly enough to have deniability.
I don't see what's so ugly about him. He's got the broad face of a brewer.
With the crotch.
The male reveals attraction through unconscious and involuntary physical signs. The puffing of the chest, mirroring, increased blood flow to the crotch. I say we start there.Pam and K
Does your husband have very soft erections? Because if not, I just grabbed a very soft penis for nothing.
I'm sorry, I fell down, Mr. Balance.
Aw, cramp, I'm just-
Yes?  Wha- Jim.
I'm fine, I'm totally fine.
Just going to walk over here-
Time for me to find out.
Jim has no discernible sense of humor, Pam. You should know that.
I can't tell. It's unnaturally sunken.  Busted. He just was mirroring. Did you see that?
Okay, just shut it.
Jim, are you serious?
Well, that's what they taught me in my 19th century kindergarten.
We have to start with a baseline question to establish what the truth is.Old M
Why don't you go check out the sympathy cards, old man?  Now I'm going to ask you just a few simple questions. Wait for this to constrict. Here we go. Is your name Jim Halpert?
Stop shoving me. Stop grabbing my penis. Grow up. Take off your jacket and take a seat. When it lies, the human body exhibits many telltale signs.
Do you really, Tin Man? Okay, where were we?
But... hey, Cece's toothbrush.
Doesn't it worry you in the slightest that Jim is not his real name?
It's not really your choice, is it? Death waits for no man.
It's important to go every month and get your prostate checked. You can do it at home by yourself with your finger. You just stick it-
Oh, he is definitely attracted to her.
Look at the numbers. Every single time, it's come up 150 over 100. Your husband is a pathological liar.
I would listen to my homemade test, because your husband is definitely lying. In fact, he's lied about every question. Even his name. Who are you really?
Yep, he's lying.
Gettysburg? Hmm. Could be interesting. Second-most northern battle in the Civil War.
Guess I'm a sucker for historical fiction.
Was it the northernmost? No. Get out of here, Oscar.
Sure! I will cede it was the second-most northernmost battle!
No, it was not. Was it the second-most northern?
No, it was not!
Not by a long shot!
Gettysburg was very important. Credit where credit is due, okay? Big, mad props to Gettysburg. Was it, however, the most northern battle of the civil war?
Okay, I will. I don't know who that is, but I'm gonna tell you this-
Yes, thank you. All of history has been whitewashed.
No, no, no! You're filling her head with nonsense. You and the history books. I'm telling the truth.
Oh, it is. And you should read some of these letters that the soldiers wrote home. I mean, it makes the battle of Gettysburg sound like a bunch of schoolgirls wrestling over a hairbrush.  I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking too. So beautifully written.
...nothing beats the battle of Schrute Farms.
Total deaths belongs to Gettysburg but when you're talking about D.P.A., that's deaths per acre...
Really. Okay, follow-up question. How much are they paying you to keep your mouth shut?
Can you tell us about the battle of Schrute Farms?Park R
Excuse me, I got a question for you.Park R
You said you werent going to look back.
YES!  Ha!  Prepare to be refuted!  Go on.
Well.  Anyone employed by the Gettysburg Industrial Complex is certainly going to want to keep quiet about the Battle of Schrute Farms.
Ive seen enough.
I know what you guys are all thinking right n
It's, it's latched closed.
It's not locked, gimme that...
Thats right Jim.
Last thing I need is luck.
No. Putting a load on more like it.
I could, but I just dont feel like it loser.
Oh thats real creative.
What are you doing? Give that back. Come on!
Your path from obesity begins right here!
Well todays your lucky day. I have opened in this very office building Dwight Schrutes Gym for Muscles. You wanna take a look?
Remember how you said that you were looking in the office to do calisthenics and aerobics?
Maybe over a beer after shes closed her first sale .
That is true.
Its the second easiest job in the world.  Being a mom.
Maybe you do. Hi. Im Dwight. Sales is really not so hard ok? Its paper. We have it and they want it so bad they are willing to pay for it.
You havent even looked around yet. Look. Gravel bucket squat yoke . You ever cut tin before? Five yards in and your forearms will be on fire. Plus I will buy the tin back from you that you cut for two cents a yard. Now lets go over membership. Im going to need the first months and the last months up front. $49 per month. But every third month is $59 a month. But the fourth month is a discount month at $19 per month
That's what I said.
Is that the same philosophy you apply to buffalo wings?  I want you to bring that same buffalo wing passion to this gym! I'm gonna make you look like Lebron James!
I was watching you. You want to know how long it really was?
I build you this temple to the human body, and you're lifting what, five pounds?
Really? Too embarrassing for you? Huh? You wish that every exercise was strutting around the gym like the Fonz? Well how do you think the Fonz got so cool? He stretched his pelvic bowl!
First thing, we're gonna stretch the pelvic bowl. Ready? Get down on the floor.
Val Kilmer? I don't buy it. That doesn't make any sense. Wow... I figured out your goal. I am going to make you the buffest dude Val Kilmer has ever seen.
What do you want!?! D
No! Because if that was the case, the bar would be up by now. What is your goal?
All right, I'll help you. But first, you gotta tell me what your goal is. What do you want?
Okay, fine. Finish your set on your own and never come back to my gym again!
What does this look like, a shower store? Get lost.
There is no shower.
Thank you, Andy.
Is it by the Sea of Tranquility?
Where? Dark side or light side?
What about my wish that we don't have to attend meetings that degrade our sense of adulthood?
No, absolutely not.
What is it?
I just wanna say, this is not my fault. OK? The weak always bully the strong. Contrary to what you see in the media. I am always acting in self-defense. Occasionally preemptive self-defense.
Fine with me. Jim can leave anytime he wants. Goodbye.
Or who in this office knows that I have access and is trying to set me up?
Yeah, I was just sitting here at my desk and I, I reached into my drawer to grab my toothbrush and some tooth powder and, and all of a sudden I was attacked by this blood thirsty rabid creature!
Yes, I was quilled.
Come down right away!
Might wanna run that by Angela cause it's so cute.
Oh is it really? Two separate times you have set me up to believe I was being recruited by the CIA.
Hello? Lacerated hand here folks.
Enough of this garbage.  Yeah!!!! Christmas!!!!
What are we gonna do with all that bonus money, Henrietta? Huh?
Took a little nap right next to Jim's desk. I feel so good right now. Mmm, cookies. What's everyone staring at?
You'll be fine over there.
It's so much closer to the bathroom, right?
You need to stop banging your pen on your desk or it's going to drive me insane.
Knew it! I knew it! Soon as I heard that wrapper.
Hmm. Impressive office you have here. Surrounded by shrubbery, like a squirrel's office.
Gabe? You don't know?
I'm not here to be given anything. I'm here to take what is mine.
Still an important position. Still a chief.
But I can give you this pitch in one minute-
You know, Gabe? You could have gone with garbage disposal, incinerator or eraser, and instead you chose toilet. God bless you. You're an American classic.
Gabe, I always wondered what it is you did around here. Now I found out. You're the bagel guy.
What? No, no. Excuse me! Lady! Get anyone from the COO's office on the phone this instant!
There's no fires within eight miles of here.
Listen, you're a perfectly fine toilet. I'm just an extraordinary piece of crap. Let's go.
You know where it is. Lead me there.
Take me to his house.
Take me to Robert.
And my character is one that will never give up until greatness is on the horizon, behind us.
What's with the smile?
Most of all, I believe that character is destiny. And my character is one that- wait why are you smiling?
Oh my God.
Robert! Robert California! Robert!
It's a job interview, not a flea market.
N... it's complicated.
Yes, exactly. Riddle number t
Let me tell you why I should be the next manager with a r
No thank you.
Really Jim? Really? Very funny.
Aw, man.  This is not very clever, Jim.
Big. Stupid. Pure chump bait.
Yeah, you want to play you little hick?
I'm relaxing. Scram.
I'm not going to help you. Why would you choose me? Because I'm mighty? Because I'm the manliest man in the office? I'll do it.
You regret attacking me now, hick? Huh?
No, you can stop.
Okay, you can stop.
No, you stop.
Hey, Cathy. Chicken fight!
We can get some chicken fights going in the pool.
I know. I could just bang you right now.
Maybe we should take a little break.
You're lying. We didn't win.
You're an idiot.
So then you won't mind if tonight I just go crazy on her, just go nuts, rrargh. With sex.
Not what I asked.
So I just want to make sure that you are completely, one hundred percent done with Erin.
I know.  But boy, that Erin. She sure is a ripe little tiger, isn't she? Rroww! And to think, I always thought of her as a second Meredith. Respectfully, I don't want us walking into a similar Angela kind of situation.
You'd be like 8 feet tall if this thing was straightened out...
No, seriously. Your spine is jacked. It's like the devil's cursive.
Hey, have you ever been checked for scoliosis?
Get her! Ruin her!
Not coming, have plans.
Of course you found him not guilty.  "Oh, he apologized and I just really want him to like me, mm."
Can't believe they let someone like you serve on a jury. Makes me question the whole judicial system.
That's good enough for me.
Okay, okay.  But let's just say that Jim was lying about jury duty. You would have to fire him, right?
I really don't want to take the chill pill.
I don't- I don't need to take a chill pill.
I have Jim on the record saying that the vic-
Jim was lying about jury duty. He was lying the whole time so he could go do yoga or go canoeing. I don't know what this pervert likes. Fire him!
I am making a citizen's arrest. You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to beg for mercy. You have the right to request judgment by combat. Dwight's rights.
Yes! Andy, get out here.
See, that's what I'm having trouble with, because the fact is, you never said he was on a bicycle.  Busted, Halpert!
And the victim rode his bicycle into the left hand turn lane but the perp was already in the left-hand turn lane?
Wait, wait. You live by the courthouse. So you drove from near the courthouse, out to Jim's house, and then back to the courthouse?
Walk us through it. What time would you get there every morning?
Great. And while we're enjoying these delicious empanadas, Jim, why don't you tell us your story again?
Okay, he remembers Toby, the most forgettable man in the known world.
He says, "No!" Boom!
Okay- oh, Jim. Hey, this guy look familiar?
That's it? This is crap!
No, no, no. You said- you said that you were-
All right, well. Let's get this show on the road, shall we? Allow me to give you a hand.
Your clients. They're all mine.
You're screwed! Oh, it's happening. It's really happening.
Gabe, it's Dwight again. Highest priority, triple-urgent. Call me. Immediately. That means ASAP.
Yes I did.
How long before?
Psh! Why? I know what Angela and the senator look like. I can mash that up in my head right now.
Oh, hey. Have you seen Gabe?
Oh, yes. Oh, what a beautiful child. Prominent forehead, short arms, tiny nose. You will lead millions...  willingly, or as slaves.
I want to see the baby.
Before I go, may I?
Admit it. Admit it.
Admit that there is a chance.
And then I inserted my penis-
-and I said, "I bet I could fulfill you," and you said, "I'd like to see you try," and then I kissed you with the force of a thousand waterfalls.
You said that Robert was not fulfilling you-
Completely true. Remember? Angela. No.
Need I remind you that we were together a month before the wedding?
I just might be his father.
Oh, you know, I did but now it seems infinitely insignificant.
Oh, right.  The office looks different now. Huh. Smaller. Maybe I just feel bigger. Hello Gabe.
What are you doing here? You just had our baby. Our collective Dunder Mifflin...family baby. Four days ago.
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, hi-yes! Yeah yeah yeah yeah!
If you make me head of sales one more time, I swear.
You can't tantalize me.
God, you're such a spy.
Eh! No plus one's. This is for competent workers only. And don't worry about the cost, Sabre is footing the bill.
Are you kidding me?! I'm supposed to get in an airplane with those nincompoops? We'd never get off the runway.
Oh my god.
Hey. Be proud of your enormous monster baby. I was once an enormous monster baby.
Uh, the Florida picks got out, and people were just kind of curious as to why they weren't picked and maybe you could just clarify?
It might be innate goodness versus innate badness? But there's an easy way to find out.  Oh Andy, gotta few questions for you.
Good point. But we're gonna be working pretty hard until five PM. After that it's gonna be beach volleyball, trips to Cape Canaveral, and sea kayaking with Gloria Estefan.
I know, you and me both, brother. It seemed kinda random to me, but he was pretty clear on who he thought truly deserved this boondoggle of a lifetime.
I can understand your pain and your rage, but you know what? Andy is an honorable man, let us not question his choices. I'm sure he had his reasons.
Oh, I'm sorry Stanley, I can't share any more details with you. You see, Andy rejected you.
Oh, no big deal. It's just that you five have been deemed most deserving of a three week all expenses paid business trip to Tallahassee, Florida.
Come up with a statement in the next hour....
Two to three hours...
Three to four hours.
Great idea! So why doesn't everyone just take the next five to six hours, come up with a statement on why you feel you deserve to go to Florida and Andy and I will listen to it.
OK hey. I specifically remember there were a lot of other people I thought should be considered.
I have already picked my t
Mm-hm. Powerpoints are the peacocks of the business world. All show, no meat.
Ok. Thank you Kevin, we'll let you know.
Wow. Seasonal effective disorder, A
You know I don't think it's a good idea for you to clear your head any more than it has been already. I think you need a workplace where the burdens of everyday life keep you tethered to reality.
Oh my god.
He doesn't even want to go.
This is stupid! Cut.
Andy, Jim is just too...essen-...
Jim is essential to th-
I wouldn't say that...it's a bit much.
You've gotta be (bleep)-ing kidding me. Ok. Ok, Florida group, welcome to the team.  AHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!
SHUT UP MAGGOT! YOU DON'T WANT TO GO, RING THE BELL! RING IT! Ring it.
Cause if any of you would prefer to stay here, all you need to do is ring this bell.
But? There's not buts. That's it. You'll wish you were dead. You seem a little disturbed, you wanna stay here?
Hot? What are you talking about? This is a nice temperate Florida morning. Eighty-five degrees, seventy-five percent humidity. This is the exact environment you will be facing for the next three weeks of your life. Welcome to special projects orientation. The next three weeks of your life are gonna be the most miserable you've ever faced. They're gonna be hard, they're gonna be dirty. You're gonna wish you were dead.
Orientation is over.
Yes. What are my expectations for the group?
No. We sell business tools and the stores need to reflect that. They need to be all business. Let all the other stores look like a toy store.
Oh, I like it.
It did, it did.
Basically Sabre has tasked us with helping them branch into the retail marketplace. They want to set up their own version of an Apple store.
Looks like Jim got mixed up with some bad apples.
Heeeere's Dwi- what the-?  Oh man.
Attention, Dunder Mifflin group. Proceed outside. The vehicle is waiting. Seats have been assigned. Shotgun goes to Ryan. Congratulations, Ryan.
I'm gonna set your face on fire.
Very funny, Jim.
I'm fine, okay? It's just stress. You know, 'cause I care about this project. And frankly the fact that none of you are vomiting or diarrheal right now I find very alarming.
Okay, Twiggy, that's enough. Get in the car.
Mmm!  There we go.
I'll do it! I always say, "You want something done right? Ask Dwight." Right? Dwight. Right? Dwight. Right Dwight, right Dwight. Sorry, now you'll never be able to get that out of your head.
What is the antidote?
You didn't poison me, it's just stress.
Send it to the frickin' moon, idiot.
Yeah, I'm gonna need an ambulance. Hold on, I have the address in my phone.  Hold on. Hold on one second. Uh, quick question. Vice president, uh, who is that? There's no name listed.
Why is everyone else standing up? Okay team, let's get back to work! Break's over!
I'm a decent baiter. My cousin Mose, that's a master baiter.
You talking about hunting? I love hunting. I'm a master hunter.
Everyone stop moving! Everyone stop wiggling! Oh, I feel like I'm gonna vomit!
I'll be on top. It's the most important position.
Mose, hey, it's Dwight. Listen, yeah, I just want to give you a heads-up.
Don't remember me like this. Remember me as the man who pulled down the screen.
Who's doing the presentations?
I'm great. How are you?
Yeah Todd, decent idea. Obvious, but interesting.
No, I don't feel like it. You do a hundred jumping jacks.
I got the surgery, what else is there to do?
Really? Okay. Retail consumer habits is...  Fast forward to today, and the retail consumer is independent, well-informed, super smart. Super smart. Okay.
What is our topic? Oh, what a topic it is.
All right, who's ready for the next presentation?
"You're too slow, you're too small, Seabiscuit is a stupid name." You guys sound just like the enemies of Seabiscuit. I'm going to do it.
No, sit down. "Seasonal." Well, the Christmas shopping season is certainly a busy one, back-to-school is, as well, and in early summer it seems to slow down a bit, but shopping is also cyclical. The menstrual cycle determines every choice a woman makes. You see, during ovulation, a woman's only goal is to get pregnant, and during menses, she is sad that she has failed. And how does the woman console herself? Shopping. Shopping. Just- Jim, could you fetch me some ice chips? Thank you. Just gonna... take a... brief pause at this point.  Oh, God. Next slide.
Oops. That's embarrassing. Egg on my face.  Ah.
Thank you very much. Any other questions? Jim?
Killing royalty. The truth be told, we should really disregard Anderson's three pillars. He was later diagnosed with dementia. You know what is important? Is Dwight's pillars, and there is only o
I'll go ahead and cancel my post-op check-up right now.
Ah! Not so fast.
You're not paying me to heal, you're paying me to kick ass.
Amazing. Just lost four ounces of appendix, already replaced it with muscle.
Yes, nice, perfect. Dragging sticks.
That's just a verb.
Waste of time.
That's a hobby, unless it's for food.
Can we at least eliminate those that are not in the running? Free them up to focus more completely on the menial. Like stacking or sorting, or-
That's not what I was going to ask. Gosh, jump to conclusions. Come on, I know, you've got so much on your plate. Right now, you're like 'oh, what's more important? Dwight's question, figure out who's the VP?' Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP. Dwight, VP.
No, they're not transferrable just 'cause I handed 'em to you.
Sure. (Hands bag to Cathy)
(takes out bag) 40. Always.
Oh, you get kicked.
That's a stupid game. I got a great drinking game. Okay, everyone empty your pockets. Whoever has the most seeds is the king. Whoever has the least buttons is the hunchback.
Genghis Khan could take 'em both down 'cause he's not afraid to kill children  What? it's true. He- He would- he would eviscerate babies and hang them from poles outside of the villages. (Jim taps Dwight on the shoulder)
Well, saddles   sometimes fall off, especially if you don't properly cinch the girth.
Hey. I see what you're doing. It's futile. the VP position is mine.
Oh please, anyone can tie a knot, the real skill is in untying it
You really want Packer as your boss?
I gotta be gone for a few minutes. You make sure that Packer does NOT sleep with Nellie.
Wait wait wait wait, bedbugs? Oh no Freak, I need a favor.
You wanna see a picture of me trapped under a tree?  ahhmmm excuse me What?! Not now, I'm busy.
We wait.  Come to papa.
Let the bedbugs bite!
Yeah.  Cover me!
You are clean. Okay One thing a bedbug thrives on is heat and carbon dioxide
God, oh. So greasy, you should just shave all this.
Everything's a joke.
Pshh. That's a bedbug.
Fair enough, but after it bit you, did it run away fearful, or did it walk away smug, self-assured?
Could be a bat weevil Describe its mood. Did it seen sleepy?
We gotta find it before it eggs.
Such a chorus girl.
No, that's the problem. Packer is trying to bed Nellie for the VP job unless I do it first.
No, you're good. Clean bill of health! Besides I gotta get back downstairs. I left Packer alone with Nellie for way too long.
If there were any in here, They would've imbedded themselves in me.
Oh, it's plenty warm, and I was farting continuously under the sheet, creating a kind of greenhouse effect.
Nope, I wasn't bitten.
Euughh Pathetic, huh? A real man swallows his vomit when a lady is present Hey.
Win at all costs, don't respect women. These are the tenets I was brought up with, and they have served me well. But my ancestors never worked in corporate America, and before that, hunters. And before that, time travelers. And before that, me again. At least, that's how the legend goes. The point is they never had to worry about how they got ahead. They just had to put food on the table and not alter the past.
There you go.
Try again Ugh, I'm still getting numbers! Seven, one, one is anyone around here thinking the numbers seven one one? 'Cause please stop, okay?
You can't stay here, this place is a biohazard. If I were you, I'd just bunk with Cathy.
I think I saw it!
It's a compound of chemicals I pulled off the maid's cart!
Where's the bug?
We went over this, ok? Your tiny fingers make the best knots.
Packer, you will be the sexual predator who has come to prey on the trendy teenage girls who are obsessed with the Pyramid.
Cathy, you will be the hot girl who talks to bloggers.
Okay. Nellie, thank you. Thank you so much.Todd P
Loam, magma, mantle, outer core, inner core.
Perfect casting, right?
Speaking of pimples, lets release the BLOGGERS!
Okay, okay. Hey, hey. Its gonna be fine. Its gonna be fine. Theres plenty of Pyramids.
Theres plenty. Dont stampede. No need to stampede, sir.
Oh, no, no, no. Its good. Its really -- on the Internet, its a really -- thats a really good, good, thing.
You could have pretended to be Chuck. I begged you to pretend to be Chuck, but you chose to be yourself, and you can no longer be Chuck! Surrender the tripack. You know what you have to do.
Good! Okay. Flirt away.
Jim, get him a water.
You just need to realize that so much rides on this. You have no idea.
Okay. I know, I know, champ. Calm down, just listen.
Its moments away. Just stay here!
Oh God... Hey no! Where do you think youre going? Youve gotta stay for the big presentation weve got this young wiz kid -- Ryan. Hes like an even more handsome Bill Gates. B
Of course theres a costume!  Oh, this is gonna be great. Theres nothing like some last-minutes changes to really energize a presentation.
Look at me. Look at me! Look... at... this... face. This is not the face of a performer. This is the face of a scary apparition you see before you die. Im telling you... if you dont do this,  I dont stand a chance. Please, Jim. J
Thats right. Will you just give us a second?
Are there any bloggers around?
Jeez! Whats he doing in there?
You are wearing eyeliner, Jim.
Hurry up. Let me in. I wanna watch you get dressed. Did you find the eyeliner? J
Hah! Yah!  Boom!
Okay! Come on!
Don't even care!
Well, Jim, I just want to say that we haven't always got along and at times, I've even hated your guts. But... bye, bye. I win.
Robert! I'm gonna win, ha ha, I'm the gentleman! Suck it!Robert C
But your face does look like the guy from Operation.Todd P
You want to do something for my own good? Turn around, walk out that door, do not stop 'til you get to Scranton, find my cell phone charger, mail it back to me, and then go hell. Todd P
What, your stylist ran out of 'messy spray'?
What are you doing here? I thought I got rid of you?
You know what? That is a great idea. Cathy, write that down and print it out. It's gonna make some really good toilet paper. J
I told you.Todd P
Nothing is gonna stop me. That is the mark of a great man. Unstoppability. Dunder-Mifflin, the farm, Mose, all those things vanish in my rearview mirror. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a date with destiny. And from what I hear, she's a slu- Ah!
You know what? You might want to get to the airport. It's gonna take you a long time to get through security with all those beauty products. Bye.
Nice try, Jim. Your pranks have never worked in the past and they're not going to work today.
That's two things.
You again? Gosh, I keep throwing you away, you keep flying back here. You're like an Amish return stick.
My wound hasn't healed yet. J
Oh, god! You... oh! My appendix-
AlI had to do was think about pie and my salivary glands did the rest. J
Then you know what? I'm just gonna have to run right through you.
I was trying to go-
Anything else you need to talk about?
This. Ends. Now.
Well this has been fun, Pam. Thanks for calling us all down here.
My warcraft clan was still on speaking terms.
I wouldn't let her manage a celery farm.
Money isn't real ever since we got off the gold standard.
Six percent, I know my worth.
Five percent. No less.
There's no limit to what I think I deserve.
I refuse to be judged by someone that I do not respect. I lost respect for you in Florida. If it was up to me, you would be in jail forever.
Well fought. I accept the outcome.
Ow! Ow, ow, ow. Ow, ow, ow, Ow.
Yes. Yes, sorry too late. I'm here. This is mine. Back off.
No, you know what? Nellie's right. That is exactly how it should work. Darryl, this office is mine now.
Neither of those looks like any person that has ever existed or been dreamt of in the history of human insanity. That said, the one on the left.
I will get the chair in. Watch the Great Schrutini work his magic.
Don't listen to Jim. Have you ever seen him play Tetris? "Oh, I think I'll just use this line horizontally. Oh, I had no idea what a gift this line is."
Why not call...
Hmm. Maybe someone threw a pie in his face. New theory- he's a hated Italian politician.
You read my mind.
Here's the two of them kissing at a beach and kissing at the Eiffel Tower. I'm guessing he's some kind of close romantic friend.
Here's the two of them taking a hike. I'm guessing he's some kind of friend.
I have to see these shoes.
If it would help you to forget, I could hit you in the brain stem with this candlestick.
That's awful. What kind of restaurant.
You heard me!
Okay scram, wizard.
Nellie let me bobble-ize him. His name is now Captain Mutato.
Erin, I am so glad that you trusted me. You came to the exact right person for this. No, I have never once experienced anything remotely like that. Never.
Erin made it clear to me that he was unable to perform sexually last night. By contrast, I went to sleep with an erection so large it was like I was wearing no blanket at all. Wow, I knew you'd win, but you just demolished him! I'm a little bit jealous, actually. Reduced him to a mere ant.
No, no, no, no, no, It's not me. I'm gonna prove it right here and now.
It's not just a human problem. Flounders frequently experience impotence, especially when converting from male to female and then back again to male.
You know, my rectal electro-ejaculator is rated for bovine use only but I could let you rent it.
Eleanor Rigby? Paperback writer?
You don't like the Beatles?
I don't even know what kind of weapon he has. Could be a knife, could be a gun. Could be a series of guns all lined up to shoot parallel. I'm going up to the roof.  And I'm gonna bring my gym bag just in case.
There is a disgruntled ex-employee sitting in his car in the parking lot.
You guess the price, you win the prize. Have you never been to a Quaker fair before? God!
If you're going to guess the price, you might as well try to be halfway accurate. $180!
Thank you. Wow, I can't tell you what an honor it is to support this thing... And obviously that amount of money is no concern to me whatsoever. But, I want to ask you s
Thank you very much! All I had to do was look at the prices, idiots! Suck it!
Oh, oh, oh! Yeah! Ha, ha!
Oh yes! Yeah!
Yes! Thank you!
Protein powder, huh? You cut it with water? Why dont you just take estrogen?  Mwah.
Oh, I bet you think its all about core, huh?
Oh, thank you.
Feast on this, Lewis.
Here, here Just
I dont need your help.
No, Jim, the butt, in his butt.
Yeah, and were not interested in your sour grapes, okay? Jim, tell him where he can stick his grapes.
And they said it couldnt be done. Boom!
Thanks so much Earl.
Good, we have a deal?
And you are
Lloyd Gross is a fictional salesman we invented to  how do I put this  steal from the company. Embezzle. To commit fraud.
Chair, lamp, plant, table leg, Jims leg.
Wait, no? Are you kidding me? You told me there was a rule. I couldve choked so many people by now.
Make a decision.
Prestige is ours. Okay, theyre responsible for half of the junk mail on the eastern seaboard. We get them. We already put a call into them, Robert.
Dont listen to him.
Okay, what are you deciding? We get a say.
Jim, you know what would be really dastardly? If we snuck out of here and got to the client first.
Got it. Go.
Hit the nos.
Come on, lets go! Does this thing have turbo? Nitrous? Hit the nos.
Go slash his tires! Go dent his hood.  Thats it? Oh, thats great. Thats like a five second delay.
Its him! Do something! Get out!
Jim, great real. This is not a monkey. Its got a hula skirt and a blue nose.
My pants fell down! I dont have a belt!
Im gonna activate the seismic failsafe. Well be stuck between floors for hours.  My pants fell down.
Ill stall him. Go!
Just run! Take the stairs!
Go, go! Take the stairs! Now!
Wait, its not D.M Utica, is it?Mr. R
I already made an appointment with your secretary.Mr. R
I was here first.Mr. R
Jim couldnt land me in a thousand years.
No. Let him get his own. Its Syracuse money.
Me too. Or do you also have a monopoly on thirst?
How have we never talked about this before? Wait. You dont even care about nationals.
Put some ice on it.
You okay, Robert?
He's searching out younger gays.
Jim, you've got those two cute kids. We sure would love to see them.
Cute kids, thanks for coming.
Jim, right here, right here.  Okay, good.
Nice to see you. May I hold him?Senator L
Okay, hold on for a second, folks. A few of the baby's hairs are out of place.Senator L
He defecated, aw.Senator L
Okay, great. Suit yourself. Although, are those excess skin cells on the baby's cheek distracting to you as well?
They're testing it now.
Yes, yes I am.
I dont see it.
Youre not getting my clients! Nice try.
Wow, thats great. Thats great. Ok, good, lets talk about that, ok?
Cause youre interested in going into sales?
With my leads and stuff like that?
You want a list of my clients? You want my leads?
Spoken like a true root man.
So what kind of farming you into, huh? You more of a fruit man or a root man?
Just how this going to be, you know? You have a beautiful round head.
Well, were both just kinda learning as we go, arent we?
Theres no belt above black. Is there a belt above black?
The new guys called a sales meeting?
Wait, saleswhat sales meeting?
The new guys. Dwight Jr is after  my job. Yeah. There is a shark hiding inside that adorable little cherub. J
This is a stupid activity. I would be embarrassed to be good at it.  Idiots.
Thats not true.  Just give me another chance.
Ok, I am just getting started, ok?
Boo, unimpressed. Its a tightrope for babies. Boo!
Come here, Ill show you.
Pam? Hey come up here, up the ladder. Come on.
I cant use Phyllis. Are you kidding me? The moment she steps off this bar Ill be launched into space. God, youre so insensitive.
Please? Please, Pam?
Come on, this will be the only thrill of your boring life.
So youll do it?
You will. Yeah we weigh about the same, wouldnt you say?
Yeah. The Taliban in Afa-ghanistan.
Which was recently discovered to be a front for the Taliban.
Fine, I chose the Global Relief Foundation.
No thank you.
I will not be participating as there is no evidence that charity works.
Well, it looks like there won't be any Operation Give Back. Ha, ha. The nanny state is over, ladies and gentlemen. You're welcome.
Absolutely, I will.
Anything else would be inconsistent.
Sounds like a plan.
This cleaver appears to need sharpening. I suggest you spend some quality time together just you and your hand. Tie a shoe, toss a salad. Do any of the two hand activities that you'll miss the most.
Oh, and let your precious Operation Power Grab proceed unchecked? No thank you.
No. It's gonna be over before you know it.
No, no. No spoilers. Please.
You, you, you, you...
You're the stupid one.
You're the stupid one.
No, like you.
Yeah, it does, actually. It makes you real stupid.
Whoopty doo. That doesn't make you a genius.
If you like James Franco, we really should watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes.

How did you know? No! No, no! That is sensitive information only for employees, not outsiders!Fake J
Alright then Jim. Ahhh, why don't you tell me about that sale that you made yesterday?Fake J
You're not Jim. Jim's not AsianFake J
Oh my! Oh d! Oh, how did?  Huhhhhh!
You wanna learn a really impressive second language? Try dothraki. Win over any man in my guild.
Ah, French. It's a great language. If you're a chain-smoking acrobat.
It means excellent. And we have begun.
Louder! Youre shouting it from the back of a horse!
More of a, barbaric growl.
He/she/it throat rips.
Daraas!   Does anyone here have fermented mares milk?
People laughed at Klingon at first, and now you can major in it.
Oh. I was joking about that whole Bund thing. Oh ho, the look on your faces! Hahhahahahahah! Hahahahahah!
Was a member of the Bund. Which is not technically the same thing as the Nazi party. So
OK, listen. Everything here is up to code.
OK, excuse me. I am the landlord. This is between me and the management, no one else. Please.
Nothing! Nothing is going on.  Keep moving please.
You people don't realize what you're asking. I'd have to rip open the walls.  We'd have to shut this place down for a week.
What? Come on.
Some of these kernels have crowned.
Psh. Keep your snacks on your side, Jim. Idiot.  What the?
No nobbies, no probbies. Nice try Jim.
Had 'em all my life.
In my contract, it is stipulated that I provide a temporary work space. It will arrive in one hour.
So, we will be leaving the office for one whole week.
Bring it in!
Get your foot behind the yellow line.
No. No! This is a work bus. The wheels are for transporting the work space to and from the work site.
It's not my responsibility to solve your marriage problems by spending my money on gas.
What can I say? I love justice. You forced me to spend money on needless repairs, and uh now you're locked in a prison bus and your woman drips with beverage.
OK, fine. You win.  Jim, you win. We have been battling for a long time, but you know what? You win, cause you are the winner, you are the alpha male, there you go.  Alpha male, go buy your wife a pie. Go buy the whole world a pie.
Stop ordering me around, Jim!
That name brand place? Nope forget about it, sorry. The tanks are so big on this thing, five cents a gallon extra, that really adds up.
I'm sorry to spoil Jim's fantastic voyage everyone, but we're almost out of gas.
That's genius. That's the best prank you've ever done.
You mean you flooded my building with dangerous electromagnetic radiation as a prank?
My trouser hives are void of honey.  I had congress with Angela and the child that she bore did not issue from my loins. I thought I would be a father and instead I am a eunuch. Neutered by my own building.
I'm barren, Jim.
Regular? Or lady on her back? You used lady on her back, didn't you, you freak. Yuck, gross. Never mind, Jim.
What position did you use to conceive?
Really? How long did it take you and Pam to conceive?
You know there's a phrase about that in German. Bildenkinder. Used almost exclusively by childless landlords to console themselves. But now? I really understand it.
Everybody! Hang on!
Oh, better than OK.  You know what honey? I'm gonna get you that rhubarb pie.
When you don't get out of the way! Out of the way!
It may have been the costliest decision Ive ever made.
I cant get it out. Try again!
Jim, no. No. No! No!
What lab did these little clones escape from?
Hello little pill. What do you do?
Oh no, Im spilling Jim all over the carpet.
Must eat more Jims. Oink oink oink oink.
Ha ha. Hey Erin, look, these are Nerds. Im eating Jims.
Jim. Look Im eating you.
Why are you trying so hard to bury this thing, huh? Whats going on Nellie? Talk to me.
Okay, this is a pill that combats insanity, okay? Whoever is taking it is not only insane...  They are now off their meds.
This is a pill that I found here in the office. But its not for worms or eczema like any normal pill. Its not for any disorder of the body.  Its for a disorder of the mind.
Ill get my apprehension kit.
I dont know. I just dont know.
Is that how they like to get in?
Is that where the nanobots like to come in?
So this makes sense then. Or is it crazy?
That makes sense to you, right? Or does it sound... crazy?
Gotcha! Yeah! Lets see ya get out of this web, huh?
Ah ha! Ha!!! The jig is up, psychopath! Ah yeah! Gotcha!
You think I dont have anxiety? I have anxiety all the time. Every waking moment of my life is sheer torture. I have land disputes Ive got to settle and idiot cousins to protect. And neer- do- well siblings to take care of. But I dont need some stupid pill to get me through all this.
All right. All right, just ...stay focused on the pill.
I agree. Yes, crap. Continue.
He says Thank you.
Which one? Mose or the real Mose?
Oh, no. No, no, no. no. Theyre not for me. Theyre for my cousin Mose. Hes just having a tough time, being wifeless, and a high pressure job and his crazy cousin Mose. Other cousin Mose.

Thank you Sandra!
That's what I'm saying! No of course not!
My resignation? What are you talking about? No! I was just following orders! Listen, the person responsible for this catastrophe is the CEO and chairman, David Wallace!
Ok, everyone. Everyone, hold on! I've got a solution. I know Wallace's phone number, everyone hold, I'll conference him in.

That is a damnable lie. I love women.
Good luck to you.
Shhh!  Thanks David! Thank you so much for calling me!
So uh, last I remember Tom Peterman was in charge of that account?
Yeah! Okay.  Hey David, Im back.
Will you run into the bathroom and tell him to eat it?
Im gonna need to put you on hold for a second.  Hah! Yah! Woooo! Eat it Jim! Eat it Phyllis! Eat... wheres Stanley?
I thought it went great.
I will tell her what her needs are and then fill them. So this is going to work out best for you if you just relax and do nothing. And once Im finished, its over.
I never sit down during sales  meetings. I want to appear aggressive and imposing. I am going to sell to you in twelve m
Okay, this isnt working for me, cause no one would ever believe that she would be a boss.
May I please speak to your boss?
Okay. With pleasure. Get ready to learn a few new tricks, old dog.
Thank you. Im so proud of them. I carried each one of them for nine months inside of my torso and then pushed them out of my vagina.
Okay, Im a woman.  Im a woman. Good?
Thats a bit extreme.
I am a person.
What are you doing?
Thats impossible. Listening happens in the ear and in the brain. I mean, some organisms have external hairs that vibrate to indicate auditory stimulation but unfortunately, our external hairs dont vibrate at all.
Little of this, little of that.
He used to fight dogs.
Okay, I can do that.
I had a barber once who used to comb my hair gently.
Look, I have no problem with women. Its businesswomen and their, their power suits and their shoulder pads. Dont lie about your shoulders!
Oh, dear God in heaven.
Just a little off the top and then a nice combing. Yeah, just comb it.
Yes, she is. Now,  I may not have any instincts with women, but I have  an instinct for sales. You keep her occupied. Ill be right back.
Hey. Your daughter could be a bubble bath model. I could just bite her head off.
Hes been growing that mustache for weeks. Best he can do... So young.

Jan... You thought I had no more cards left to play. Well Ive got one. Man-boy! The Ace of Babes.
Because you are my friend and you are a woman... And women love gossip. Its like air to you people. Ugh, God.
Thats all you need. And when I have curried favor with her, I will let you know.
Oh, I got her number. 415-YCL.
Oh and uh, Molly... I know it cant be easy working for Jan. Good luck with your feelings.
Oh, look at that. Yeah, hes free anytime. Not a problem.

Oh, dont lie. Im trying to save those precious knees youre always bragging about. Now, lets get out of here. He could be right behind us.
Dont move. And disarm now!
I just saved your life. Youre welcome! O
See ya later, Trevor.
Where are gay mens vaginas?
We heard it was called red-vining.
Philadelphia. From the greek phila meaning "Love," and adelph, meaning "Adolf." "the city that loves Adolf." Good luck with your new enterprise and don't wear the blue striped shirt. It makes your neck look like an old mop handle.
What about an authentic Pennsylvania Dutch Christmas? Drink some gluhwein, enjoy some hasenpfeffer. Enjoy Christmas with saint Nicolas' rural German companion, Belsnickel.
Have you ever tasted a Shepherd's Crook?
This is austere, Meredith. This is celebrating Christmas for all of the right reasons. The cookies and toys and sweets are mere distractions. I mean, most people don't even know that a candy cane represents a Shepherd's Crook, which I assure you does not taste like peppermint. It tastes like sheep feces. O
It is stuffed pig stomach. And, after we finish it, we get to break the pig rib. J
What? It's a Pennsylvania Dutch specialty. Hog maw. That's a beauty, isn't it? I don't even want to tell you what it's made of until after you try it.
That is gluhwein, otherwise known as glow-wine, also used to sterilize medical instruments. And, interesting factoid, this is the very spoon that guided my soft skull through the birth canal when I was born. Enjoy.
Judgment is nigh, for the belsnickel ist I!
Okay, great. Seriously, you guys? Now you believe in Dwight's traditions, when some democrat looks it up on wikipedia?
No, much better--No one fears santa the way they fear belsnickel. J
No, I'm carrying around the stick in order to look cool. For the kinder
You can't have the bowl! Oscar Martinez, cheer or fear? Belsnickel is here! I judge your year
It's a set of rubber gaskets for canning jars. P
Impish or admirable. J
Of course I checked it. J
I decided earlier.
In a head-to-head contest, people prefer belsnickel over santa every time. There aren't as many songs about him, but I attribute that more to rhyming difficulties. My brother and I wrote one once. it was about a fickle pickle salesman who would tickle you for a nickel.
They're not abandoning the party.
I judge you impish!
But you work tomorrow. J
It's a punishment.  Hey, where are you going?
Stop giggling. P
Party's over. You quit on Christmas, Christmas quits on you.
I found it! J
No, thanks. I'll just have another dumatril. Jim taught me this really cool way to take it. You crush it into a powder, and you snort it up your butt. J
Just lice Pam?
What? Lice? Oh my god. Lock the doors, we are on full quarantine.
Should be. I use lice shampoo every morning.
Renters. Ok, I'm gonna need you to gather your belongings, retreat to the warehouse, conduct your business there until the infected have been deloused. Let's get going. I'm gonna stay here and fight. If you don't hear from me by lunch, call me. I might want lunch.
It's a Hazmat suit. That stands for hazaderous materials men's suit wearing. If you rent more than four times a year, it just makes sense to buy. Is there anyone else here that is lice free?  Excellent. Do you have your own hazmat suits?
Let's talk pubes, people.
I'm not gonna lie. Lye!
To be burned!
Oh God, oh no. No. No. No! No! No! No! No!
Oh sure, and when you're ready to get serious, come to me to get it done right.
Yeah there's a volume knob on that thing.
She's right Pam.
Whoa. Hypertoxide has a mild hallucigenic effect, but I don't think it's kicked in yet. I'm gonna count down from ten. Nine, yellow, cold, sad, purple.
Mmm. Thats a good question. 300 times  Yes. Oh, well, thank you Jim. Yes, I am better than you. Thanks for acknowledging that. Okay, bye bye. Love you.
How is that my problem? Get in your car and drive down here. You can make it in 30 minutes if you drive 240 miles per hour.
Oh, do you really have ears, Phyllis? Like all human beings? We all have ears.  See what you leave me with here, Jim?
Phyllis, my sister? More like my dead great great grandmother who died of stupidity.
Oh, god, this again? Youre Stinky.
Then looks like we have a deal Son
How would you like to pretend to by my son in order to land a sale?
Gosh, you know, I wish I could but, uh No. Hey, listen, remember how everyone used to call you Dwight Junior and how much you loved that?
It was his birthday, just turned three. SoSuit Store F
Guilty!Suit Store F
You know, youre right! We hadnt even thought of that, had we boy?
Yes! Genius. Stupid, stupid genius!
We dont get along.
Youre being disrespectful!
What took you so long? Were you loitering out there like a hooligan, smoking a doobie?
Well, things between me and Clark are good, but not great. In fact, I will say that theyre not even good. Really, theyre bad. Like you and your son.
Oh really.Suit Store F
Got cat turd collector written all over him.Suit Store S
Following the cat around on his knees with his hands cupped beneath its tail, going please kitty, may I have some more? You cant make this stuff up!
Glistening brown morsels tumbling from every pouch in his trousers.
That never happened. Hes always been a liar. Ever since he was a little kid. He got caught saving treats from the kitty litter box.Suit Store F
Yeah? Like what?
His last girlfriend was a transvestite. I knew it right away. Adams apple like the prow of a ship, thumbs like a lowland gorilla. Ha, but this one couldnt see it, or didnt wanna see it.
Maybe if you listened a little bit, youd improve. No wonder women despise you.
I bet you have. He knows nothing about what people have heard before, my son.
Wait, so youre the boss?Suit Store S
Us old timers need to stick together. And how better than by signing a contract?Suit Store F
Do you mind? The men are talking.Suit Store F

That place doesnt exist. Its not a documented island. Ha ha, cartograph much?
Yeah, you dont want Italian. Youll look like a mafia don. Next thing you know, youll be doing life in Rikers Island.

And you closed it. The boys are back in town.  High fives! Ha ha!
Higher than numbers go. The ceiling above accounting!
A lightbulb. Okay. Okay.  Invisible ink.

No. Ill be damned if Im gonna let us lose me. J
Uh, not far at all, but I thought along the way, we could play some sports.
Its a youtube thing! Lets go. Lets go. Come on, theyre coming.
Wait, what you doing? No, I need the k-- We have to go.
Ha ha! Yeah, jokes on you buddy! They make you come back and clean it up!
What? What was that? Did I just hear you laughing with glee? D
Oh, did I? Oh, yes, I did.
I chose my words very carefully.
Ive worked here for 12 years. I won salesman of the year. Im an Assistant to the Regional Manager. R
Well, Im the one offering the job. R
There were only two options. T
Think Dwight, think. You have a ream of 16-bond 
Damn it! Perfect answer, again. C
This is Dwight Schrute. Who am I speaking to? And dont lie. I can tell if youre lying. David W
Im not. These people are the best of the best. I find talent an attractive quality in a friend. N
Okay. Good, good, good.
Okay. Good. That was great. So. Wow. Youre still at the 570 number? W
I will pay you whatever it takes. W
Or none of you
What? This is such bullcrap!
Welcome to the club, pig!
If there's anything I hate worse than art, it's crime.
Pam, I'll help you. P
Let's go everyone. Super secret, classified conference room meeting, now!
You're telling me, David Wallace asked you to call a super secret, classified conference room meeting?
You don't have the clearance to call a conference room meeting.
You need my pitchfork?
If I get the deicing gig, it's not gonna be on merit. Not because I played politics.
Ah, I'm not interested.
What is it? I have vengeance to exact.
It's all right. It's all right.
Or melons. Like cantaloups. With the halves are cut off. And then, just the bottom parts... N
Incorrect. It is my fetish. Oh, also, sign them. My fetish is signed drawings of butts.
There's no gum. There never was any gum.
You know who the vandal is. Now, I know a lot of these warehouse guys are your friends, but we've got chewing gum.
No. She needs her rest again. N
Oh, your little feelings party didn't work out? Huh? Who won the hugging contest? Oh, let me guess. Everyone tied for first.
He even looks like a mole.
I know just the man for the job.
Go all Hammurabi on this clown.
A little eye for an eye action.
Go move some paper!
Silence. You'll now be working in the warehouse with the untouchables. Now, go make your hands rough with work.
So we know which truck to van... D
Ugh! Don't sympathize. You're ruining the mood. Back to work. Draw his penis.
I saw that. That's great!
This is amazing! Frank! And he's leaving a trail of poops?
Let's see yours. P
Yeah. Frank draws a butt on your mural, I'm drawing your mural on Frank's truck's butt. Eye for an eye, mamacita.
I would be happy to. It would be my pleasure, Mr. Schrute. Rick-a-dick-doo, rick-a-dick-dick-dick, rick-a-dick-doo.
Andy, hi. I just made another huge sale for the company that you manage. I need you to authorize that expense report and sign off on that contract.
You're back.  And you're disgusting.
No. Please. Come on, Clark. Wallace knows that he's been gone for the last three months.  Right? Wallace does know that you've been gone for the last three months?
Please Ja, Ja...
No, Jan! Please do not listen to this boob! Remember Clark. He gave you everything. Everything.
Don't you dare! Andy!
No!  What do you think you're doing?
Not a word.
I'm not gonna say it.
In the ocean.
On a boat.
You were on a boat.
God! I just don't know what we'd do. I mean, short of telling David Wallace that he was gone for three months.
The whole thing is in ashes. Fire department was here. It was in all the papers. K
 lit the whole thing on fire. It was crazy.    A
Well, we had the Scranton White Pages.
..where it was and it needs, it needs a...
It's a divet...
It's like a prehensile wing or something, you know?
There's this one hanging part in particular, that's some sort of flap.
And there's parts of her I don't even recognize.
Angela. You owe me one, remember? Now please, she's an old woman Angela. She needs a woman's touch. It's all hanging out-
Probably nothing, or strychnine. Or lemonade and strychnine. Which is actually what it was.
You have no idea. I mean her hair, clothes, it's all falling off in great big clumps. And we need someone to go out there and clean her up. We had a nurse, but she quit because she was poisoned by Aunt Shirley.
It's my aunt Shirley, she's on her last legs.
And you should take breaks more often, I've been waiting there for 45 minutes.
How dare you?
It keeps her docile. Go to the kitchen, get the largest receptacle you can find.
Yeah, trust me.
Ok, Aunt Shirley, dear, uh, can I get you a nice crisp liter of schnapps?
You know what? Before you put the new clothes on, Angela's gonna get you cleaned up a little bit.
This is Angela, and we brought you some new clothes!
No, it's a lot better than it sounds. There's a private shower area. Very tasteful, very rustic.
Now all it takes is half a liter. She's dreaming. Alright, let's get her out to the yard so you can spray her down.
In her prime, Shirles could put away homemade schnapps morning noon and night.
Give me the hose!
OK you are useless.
I need you to hose my aunt.
Give it a whirl.
Let's get to it.
Let's do it! Ready? Here's a box cutter to get her clothes off.
You'll see. Here we go.
It's hosing time Aunt Shirley, have a seat. You're gonna have a hard time hearing her over the roar of the hose.
No, you don't eat it. It's a toy, like a wish bone. You know, prettiest girl gets the stink sack.
Would you like the stink sack?
By all means. And I will carve the roast skunk. Angela?
And you look like one too. Thank you Angela.
Stand by your man. It's what I would want if you were mine.
I'm not talking about some frisky romp in the warehouse. We have wasted too much of our lives ignoring the fact that we belong together. The eighty or ninety years that I have left in this life...I want to spend with you.
Leave him. He probably won't even notice that you're gone. Be with me, Monkey.
Right. Not outside. The horseflies. You know what? My farm is only a few acres East of here. Or, we could use the slaughterhouse.
I would say that she raised me, but let's not kid each other. I raised myself. She was, however, the closest thing I had to a mother.
I am dressed according to the Schrute codes of mourning. My aunt Shirley has died.
In keeping with Schrute custom, I will either invite you to Saturday's funeral by sprinkling red, fertile dirt in your face. Or, I will ask you to keep a respectful distance during my time of grief, with a dusting of black, slightly acidic soil. E
I miss her so much.
I really hope so.
Get in the sidecar. Get in the sidecar.
Are you going?
Jeb, my brother.
So, let's get it going.German M
Well, if you can snap two chicken necks with a single motion, why use two motions to slaughter those chickens.
Hi Esther. Nice of you to come today.
I see Esther's back in town.
You were late. So, what am I supposed to do?
You had black hair and then gray hair.
Well, thank god they're not because we don't want to make zombies.
Well, the only thing we're planting here is dead bodies.
Doesn't matter. It's a cemetery.
Thank you.Aunt S
Oh my god.
Of course you are.
You will say 'yes' on one. Five, four, three, two, get ready to say 'yes', one. Yes. Z
You know what? Let's take a couple of nights and stay here and think about Aunt Shirley's offer.
If you want.
Which is fine. And, you learned something. But, it was kind of a stupid question so you're gonna get made fun of a little bit.
Yes, very. You really need to stand back because these are killer chickens.
OK, you suck at this. Give me those teats. Didn't your father teach you anything?
Well, is the udder hot? Is the milk clumpy?
Come here. Come on. Grab a teat with each hand. Sit down. There you go. Squeeze from top to bottom. Really pull. Use some muscle. Draw the milk out. All right. Going all right?
Did you just ask me if this was a cow?
This? No. That'd be cool, though. It's for milking.
It.  That kid doesn't put in some farm time, he's gonna stay like that.
It's OK guys, she's no longer horny. A
OK, you are useless. I'll take care of this.
Phyllis is masturbating. In the office right now as we speak. A
A long term tractor lease is going to put pressure on a relationship. C
What do you think?
Well, we've been out three times, there has been physicality but the thing is we were hanging out with her father the other night looking at a farm catalog, next thing I know he wants to lease a tractor with me. C
Lives on the neighboring farm. 85 acres.
Yes. Esther, you look radiant as always. E
I just need a moment to consider your offer. Excuse me.
No woman would ever want a man who doesn't know what an auger is. Mr. R
I am closing a deal on a tractor with the father of a woman I plan to inseminate. C
Right, standard. C
So, you're fine with me not leasing the tractor? I mean, our courtship can proceed?
Well, the alert was already set to Red because of Stairmageddon. You think I should set it to Double Red?
The buyer is your sisters friend. This is the printing paper for the entire school district of Lackawanna. You are coming, and thats an order.
Well, I did say it would be an inconvenience. You should have called me from downstairs. We couldve met in the lobby. Its time to go out on a sale! Here we go.
Mm-hmm. Good luck.
So what Im hearing you say is, Make Stanley go out on the sales call by whatever means possible?
Stanley is refusing to go out on a sales call.
Its all right. Andy approved it.
Dont worry, its just a bull tranquilizer. Nothing to be alarmed about. Its just a man pointing a bull tranquilizer at a coworker.
Stanley, one way or another, you are gonna come with me to make this sale.
Move it! One, two, three.
Shh. Got about 45 minutes to get him to the client before he comes to.  Lets go!
Okay, this dosage was meant for a very small bull, and Stanleys got way more body fat than they do.
I know. Evel Knievel.
Thank you. I mean, Ive rehearsed it in my head like 1,000 times, but, uh
Okay, listen. Im kind of embarrassed to admit this, but Ive never actually done this before.
Lets go right to the top of the stairs, okay?
Lets take him
What about you?
I might see a movie.
Okay. Good call. He would have put a hole in your chest same as he put a hole in that wall.
Its 15 feet down, its at a 45-degree angle. Get set in your haunches, its like your catching a medicine
You use your hands and just blunt his descent, okay? Hes gonna be moving slowly. Its only
Okay, now heres the plan. Im gonna launch him. I need you to go to the bottom and catch him.
Lets get him inside.
Are you kidding me? The bubble wrap is the only thing thats stopping his suit from getting wrinkled. These meetings are all about presentation.
Its by the tenderloin.
Hoist his shank on three.
Fine, lets go.
Well, Ill grab the forelegs, and you push his hindquarters.
Get in the back.
Get in the back.
New plan, okay? We get him a cup of coffee and we go back to the old plan. Lets go! Gimme a hand. Here we go. Come on, Stanley! Here we go. Upsie-doozie. There we go. Okay, all right. Come on, big guy. You can walk, right? Yeah. What a pretty smile. Lets go.
Oh, God, this is bad. Looks like weve got no choice. You, my friend, are going to have to be Stanley Hudson.
Like this? Watch.
Look at him. Ive never seen such a beautiful child.Mrs. D
Its a long drive. He was in the backseat. But right now were talking to Mrs. Davis about the full range of the products that we offer and our competitive rates, right, Stanley?
Hes fine. He gets carsick really easily.
We need a winch and a hoist.
You earned yourself a nice, fat commission and you didnt even know it. Ill go tell Andy the good news. Oh.  Silly me. Gotta take the stairs.
Hey, that is a really nice plane.  You make that yourself? K
What are you-  You're here early. E
Oh, Esther. E
Watch and learn. E
In a way.  But not in a stand up and cheer kind of way, like the song.
Yes. I pity her. She was recently in a situation where she could have had it all, and instead she lost everything. E
Smasher? No, whered you get that? Fireball. This morning after hours of combat with some of the citys best teenagers I earned my black belt in Goju Ryu martial arts.
Ah!  Thats how its done.
He will now perform the ceremonial cutting-off-of-the-belt.
Just slip it off mySlip it off my hips. S
Take my belt, master. I now submit to you every part of myself.
He will now perform the ceremonial changing of the belts!
Watch this part, okay?David W
We did it, we did it. I love you.
Yeah, I did. But I made too many mistakes. Its out of my reach now. Besides, I think Jim would be a fine manager. Id be happy to see Jim as manager.
You did not just say that! You dont know Pam. She is really cool.
Thank you. So I saw you talking to Wallace earlier. Is he going to offer you the managers job?
You wanna get rid of a headache, you sit on something sharp. Any sensei will tell you that.
Andy, I have nothing to gain from getting you to stay, and everything to gain from you leaving. But please, I have known you for years, I have seen you perform. Dear god, dont quit your day job.
Oh, I doubt youll make it. Very few do whove tried to be a star. But, listen, youve saved up enough money to take a couple of years off to pursue your dream and have some fun, right?
This is exciting! Youre finally gonna get to go out and flap your wings.
Big day for you.
I will never, ever let you down.David W
In case Michael or Andy ever got killed in a traffic accident and there was a trade show on the same day. You will not regret this decision, David.David W
But this isnt interim manager. No. Its Dwight K. Schrute  Manager.David W
Im sorry. Ive just waited for this moment my entire life. I mean, I was interim manager once, but then I shot that gun. David W
What branch?David W
Assistant regional manager.
I wanted to offer you a new position.
Youre an annex kid. You might be bullpen, well see. Give it a couple of years. Scram.
Get out of Jims seat.
Thank you, Jim.
Come on. Come on. David W
Just wait and send it to voicemail.David W
Its just one thing. Just let melet me do thisDavid W
David. Can I just do one thing while youre making this announcement and then Ill never, ever do it again?David W
Yes, it is. Carry on.
No, no. Give me the steam.
Ah, much, ok.
The coffee in Paraguay is colder?
This is Tuesday, right? The coffee in Paraguay is far hotter?
But the coffee in Peru is far hotter.
Oh, dont worry. Theyll get got.
You know what to do.  Ok
Good call. Together we run a no-nonsense office.
Once upon a time we were natural enemies, but weve overcome our differences. Much like Germany and Italy in World War
Ok. Um, new agenda item. Phillip will be joining us in the office today.
What is going on?
Have a seat, Phyllis. There we go. As you know, I like to begin each day with an inspirational quote. Some say the only failure there is is the failure to try.  That is wrong. Failure of any kind is failure. Jim, over to you.
Please take an agenda item.
That doesnt sound crazy, Jim. Thats the sanest thing Ive ever heard.
I like the sound of that. Who do you have in mind?
Id have to get some more wire and string, but its doable. Do you think any of them out there are capable?
Someone to whisper in the ear of the consigliore.
A loyal, but bungling apostle.
The power source.
Yes, good abbreviating, Jim. That saved some time. Now, hurry up, shut the door. Break it down for me.
Which is, of course
Hey, hey! Seriously?
You dont need to repeat right now, when Im saying it.
Wow, the honor. God, I envy them.
Youll always have the upper hand, when youve got a good a-arm. Trademark pending.
We owe Andy that much. Am I right people?
Wait, no, no, no, stop. Spouses can read each others minds. Youre trying to give your wife this job.
Not even close, Meredith. Come on!
No, no, no, no! You dont read it aloud like that! God! Besides, the whole thing is a trick question. Theres no Turkish ambassador to Armenia. The two countries dont have diplomatic relations.
Jim, this is gonna come as no surprise but I know exactly what you are going to say. The only possible assistant to my assistant-
Augh! Ah! Here you are, sir! Heres your coffee! Ah, my skin, ow, ow! It burns! Ah! J
No, no, no! Phyllis, seriously?
A thousand times more.
Smart baby. Thats the most flavorful bond.
Oink the pigs, that is very important.
Hey, he can handle it.
On an innocent baby.
I need you to perform a test.
Okay.  You ever been in a managers office before?
Hey, you want me to take the little diaper blaster? Pam can attest, theres no one better at getting brats to shut their yaps.
Yeah. Any ordinary child would have taken the money, but youre no ordinary child are you? No. I can tell by your gorgeous, widely-set eyes.
That is because this baby is of superior intelligence. He can tell when hes being tricked out of the experience of a real human breast.
Then the two of you would move to my 1,600-acre estate, which, lets face it, is a big step up from living in a gay mans closet.
I believe that boy may be a Schrute. And if he is, that child needs to be accorded what is his. An enormous farm, an inheritance, and the right to be raised under rigorous Schrute traditions. You will, of course, be compensated with a marriage proposal.
Door. Chair. Its about Phillip.
Jim! I need my assistant to the regional manager. Code red.
And did I mention that she weaves? Colorful, durable blankets and rugs! It all adds up.
Plus her dowry contains a walk-in freezer full of frozen, premium cattle sperm.
Shes got a ton of great qualities. Shes young, shes beautiful, genes so pure you could lick them. Her family admires me, my family tolerates hers. A lot of them are the same people because were third cousins, which is great for bloodlines and isnt technically incest.
I was thinking of proposing to Esther today.
Thats very true. Get the hell outta here. J
Youre a good assistant, Jim.
Move to the side of the road!
Get out! Im a dad!
What? Why would you say that
I love you!
This is a ring, taken from the buttocks of my grandmother, put there by the gangster patriarch of the Coors dynasty, melted in a foundry run by Mennonites.
This expresses how loudly I love you.
Listen to me! I love you! And I dont care that Phillips not my son. I will raise 100 children with 100 of your lovers if it means that I can be with you!
Shut up, woman!
pff, Nobody buys DVDs anymore. C
Toby, wait. Wait. Hold that thought. Heres your cake.   Bye, bye Toby. K
Basedon his merit. O
Well if anyone here can make a case for Kevin staying. A
Its a colloquial way of saying youre fired, Kevin, which you are.
Go ahead and just read the frosting. K
No! And our next and most thickly frosted cake isforKevin. K
What was that for? A
Woo! Okay! J
Okay, what are you doing? Are you giving me a taste of the chefs special? Tastes like cigarettes. That wont work. Thats no good.
No, we havent ordered anything. No ones even taken our drinks. Uh, what is the chef special?   S
I heard you say well the first time.
You? You did this as a prank. My own Bestich Mensch. J
Yes, it is! I am here for my bride! M
I missed you Kevin.
No. We cant see each other on our wedding day. And her legs are still numb from being in the trunk. J
Michael. I cant believe you came.
I think youre only a teeny
Not significant is a big word
Oh, come on. Ive never heard of such a thing.
Oh, no. What?
Ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for coming. Now, please take your hay bales to the reception. Theyll be used for seating. Complimentary hay hooks are placed alone the aisles. Just stab em on in there.
Good night. T
Woah. Right. For what, the art? The music? The incredible nightlife? No thank you. But if youre ever in the area, youll always have a place to stayin my barn. J
Dont be an idiot. Its for the severance. The best I can do one month for every year youve been here. Thats the max. P
No, dont say it. Youre fired! Youre both fired!
