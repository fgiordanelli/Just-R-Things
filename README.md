## Synopsis

Just R Things is a blog I started in July 2016 to share my knowledge in R that I have acquired over the years. Topics covered (and hoping to cover) includes tips on writing clean and efficient codes, vizualizations, data wrangling, statistical procedures, R Shiny app-building, etc.

This is the repository for all the R scripts and R Markdown files used to product blog posts in Just R Things.
